However, what happens when lockdown measures are relaxed? This paper considers how the COVID-19 pandemic affects crime rates throughout Mexico when the stay-at-home orders end. We use national crime data from Mexico’s National Public Security System, which reports municipality-level rates on assault & battery, theft & property crime, fraud, drug crimes & extortion, and homicides. Our results show that the majority of crimes follow a U-shaped trend—when the lockdown ends—crimes rise back to pre-pandemic levels.",COVID-19 | Crime | Lockdown | Mexico | Pandemic,,"Abrams, D. S.

In an effort to inform the general public and with support of the Arkansas Attorney General’s office our team sought to keep track of narratives for research purposes and provide near-real-time public documentation via a website with two main goals. The first is to track every unique narrative as curated by our analysts. This allows individuals to fact-check the information they consume. The second goal is to relay recommendations to the State Attorney General on how to detect such misinformation and avoid fraud and scams seeking to profit from this online fear and chaos. This paper showcases our website as well as some research findings from the data we collected.

In the chaotic modern society, there is an increasing demand for the realisation of true ‘fairness’. In this study, we propose a fair distribution method ‘using physics’, which imitates the Greek mythology, Themis, having a ‘balance of judgement’ in her left hand, for the profit in games of characteristic function form. Specifically, we show that the linear programming problem for calculating ‘nucleolus (a solution for the fair distribution)’ can be efficiently solved by considering it as a physical system in which gravity works. In addition to significantly reducing the computational complexity, the proposed scheme provides a new perspective to open up a physics-based policymaker that is adaptable to real-time changes. We will be able to implement it not only in liquid systems but also in many other physical systems, including semiconductor chips. The fair distribution problem can be solved immediately using physical systems, which should reduce disputes and conflicts based on inaccurate information and misunderstandings, eliminating fraud and injustice.",,,"Arrow KJ (1951) Social choice and individual values.

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. Methods: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. Results: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV. Conclusions: Innovative and sustainable strategies informed by comparative risk assessment are increasingly needed to ensure that local economic, social, demographic, and epidemiological risks and potentials are accounted for in the national COVID-19 responses.",Africa | COVID-19 | Essential medicines | Health policy | Health systems | SARS-CoV-2 | Universal health coverage | Vaccines,"Africa | COVID-19 | Developing Countries | Drugs, Essential | Health Services Accessibility | Humans | Patient Safety | Prospective Studies | Quality of Health Care | SARS-CoV-2 | Universal Health Care | Vaccines","World Health Organization.

Around 100 million people in Brazil (50% of the inhabitants) are users of social media networks – almost half of the country’s population. Most of the information on the Internet is unregulated, and its quality remains questionable. Methods: In this study, we examine the main characteristics of misinformation published on the topic. We analysed 232 pieces of misinformation published by the Brazilian fact-checking service “Agência Lupa”. The following aspects of each news item were analysed: a) In what social media has it circulated?; b) What is the content classification, sentiment and type of misinformation?; d) Are there recurrent themes in the sample studied? Results: Most were published on Facebook (76%), followed by WhatsApp, with 10% of total cases. Half of the stories (47%) are classified as “real-life”, that is, the focus is on everyday situations, or circumstances involving people. Regarding the type of misinformation, there is a preponderance of fabricated content, with 53% of total, followed by false context (34%) and misleading content (13%). Wrong information was mostly published in text format (47%). We found that 92.9% of misinformation classified as “fabricated content” are “health tips”, and 88.9% of “virtual scams” are also fabricated. Conclusion: Brazilian media and science communicators must understand the main characteristics of misinformation in social media about COVID-19, so that they can develop attractive, up-to-date and evidence-based content that helps to increase health literacy and counteract the spread of false information.",Brazil | Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Fact check | Misinformation | Pandemic | Politics | Social media,,"Brooks SK, Webster RK, Smith LE, Woodland L, Wessely S, Greenberg N, et al.

The bubble was fueled by the usual culprits: fraud, excessive risk, and lax standards, particularly in the non-agency mortgage universe. Underlying all of these factors was a systemic lack of transparency and quality reporting that prevented these issues from being reconciled and resolved. Since then, legislation has been imposed to regulate the mortgage industry, protect consumers from predatory lending practice, and rebuild the economy. Similarly, issuers have made substantial underwriting changes to prevent prior lending excesses. The improvements made, however, have not addressed the core issue, and legacy systems for accessing, managing, and analyzing loan data have remained largely untouched. Data are the basis of safe and critical decision making, but it continues to be inaccessible, costly, and unvalidated. To restore investor confidence, especially as COVID-19 proves to be a destructive force, the industry requires modernization; otherwise, it may never truly recover.",,,"Aldasoro, I., and T.

The combination of a public health emergency, economic distress, and misinformation-driven panic have pushed customers and vendors towards the shadow economy. In particular, dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial websites accessible via free software, have gained significant popularity. Here, we analyse 851,199 listings extracted from 30 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020. We identify 788 listings directly related to COVID-19 products and monitor the temporal evolution of product categories including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medicines (e.g., hydroxyclorochine), and medical frauds. Finally, we compare trends in their temporal evolution with variations in public attention, as measured by Twitter posts and Wikipedia page visits. We reveal how the online shadow economy has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of a continuous monitoring of DWMs, especially now that real vaccines are available and in short supply. We anticipate our analysis will be of interest both to researchers and public agencies focused on the protection of public health.",Bitcoin | COVID-19 | Dark Web Marketplaces | Shadow economy,Commercial websites | Continuous monitoring | Health emergencies | Personal protective equipment | Product categories | Public agencies | Shadow economies | Temporal evolution,"Taylor DB (2020) A timeline of the coronavirus pandemic. https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html Accessed August 2, 2020.

In such an unprecedented context, it is important to understand how technology is mediating the educational process and how teachers and students are experiencing the change brought by the pandemic. This research aims to understand how the learning was mediated by technology during the early stages of the pandemic and how students and teachers experienced this sudden change. Data were collected following a qualitative research design. Thirty in-depth and semi-structured interviews (20 students and 10 teachers) were obtained and analysed following a thematic analysis approach. Results provide evidence on the adoption of remote education technologies due to the pandemic with impacts on the education process, ICT platforms usage and personal adaptation. The emergency remote education context led to mixed outcomes regarding the education process. Simultaneously, ICT platforms usage was mostly a positive experience and personal adaptation was mostly a negative experience. These results bring new insights for higher education organizations on actions they could take, such as curating the learning experience with standard, institutional-wide platforms, appropriate training for students and teachers, and suitable remote evaluation practices. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the world's education environment into an unstructured, emergency remote education process. There is a lack of understanding of how ICT tools mediated learning during pandemic's early stages and how actors experienced this sudden change. In technology-mediated learning contexts, participant beliefs, knowledge, practices and the environment mutually influence one another and affect the lived experience. What this paper adds The paper identifies and characterizes the educational process, the technological tools used in this new educational setting and personal adaptation of higher education students and teachers during these unprecedented times. The results show the following: an increase in teacher–student interaction (outside classes), new opportunities and content development; difficulties in control evaluation fraud, constraints in attaining the desired learning outcomes and lack of training; resilience to adapt and adopt the new technologies, despite the negative personal experience lived in terms of productivity, motivation, workload and mental health. Implications for practice and/or policy The paper makes evidence-based recommendations on how higher education institutions can leverage this experience to prepare for future disruptions and increase the use of ICT tools in their regular learning environment.",COVID-19 | emergency remote education | higher education | online learning | qualitative research | technology-mediated learning,Educational settings | Higher education institutions | Higher education students | Learning environments | Qualitative research | Semi structured interviews | Student interactions | Technology-mediated learning,"Adedoyin, O.

The distribution fitting, time series modeling along with predictive monitoring approaches, and epidemiological modeling are illustrated. When the epidemiology data is sufficient to fit with the required sample size, the normal distribution in general or other theoretical distributions are fitted and the best-fitted distribution is chosen for the prediction of the spread of the disease. The infectious diseases develop over time and we have data on the single variable that is the number of infections that happened, therefore, time series models are fitted and the prediction is done based on the best-fitted model. Monitoring approaches may also be applied to time series models which could estimate the parameters more precisely. In epidemiological modeling, more biological parameters are incorporated in the models and the forecasting of the disease spread is carried out. We came up with, how to improve the existing modeling methods, the use of fuzzy variables, and detection of fraud in the available data. Ultimately, we have reviewed the results of recent statistical modeling efforts to predict the course of COVID-19 spread.",distribution fitting models | epidemiological models of disease | estimation | parameters | prediction | time series regression models,,"CDC.

Current anti-counterfeiting labels have weaknesses: they can either be duplicated easily, are expensive or ill-suited for the existing complex supply chains. While RFID tags provide for an excellent alternative to current anti-counterfeiting methods, they can prove to be expensive and other routes involving nanomaterials can be difficult to encrypt. A DNA based anticounterfeiting system has significant advantages such as relative ease of synthesis and vast data storage abilities, along with great potential in encryption. Although DNA is equipped with such beneficial properties, major challenges that limit its real-world anti-counterfeiting applications include protection in harsh environments, rapid inexpensive sequence determination, and its attachment to products. This review elaborates the current progress of DNA based anti-counterfeiting systems and identifies technological gaps that need to be filled for its practical application. Progress made on addressing the primary challenges associated with the use of DNA, and potential solutions are discussed.",,"Base Sequence | Consumer Product Safety | Counterfeit Drugs | COVID-19 | DNA | Fraud | Humans | Nanostructures | Nanotechnology | Pandemics | Quality Assurance, Health Care | Radio Frequency Identification Device | SARS-CoV-2",,Review,,0,22454,2-s2.0-85107390548,18733476,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85107390548&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85107390548&origin=inward

It concentrates on administrative errors in unemployment insurance (UI) decisions, which give rise to a public values conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. This conflict is first described and then highlighted in the history of the US UI regime. Machine learning may not only mitigate this conflict but it may also help to combat fraud and reduce the backlog of claims associated with economic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The article uses data about improper UI payments throughout the US from 2002 through 2018 to analyze the accuracy of random forests and deep learning models. We find that a random forest model using gradient descent boosting is more accurate, along several measures, than every deep learning model tested. This finding could be explained by the goodness-of-fit between the machine learning method and the available data. Alternatively, deep learning performance could be attenuated by necessary limits to publicly-accessible claims data.",Administrative Errors | AI | Public Administration | Social Policy | Unemployment Insurance,Economic crisis | Goodness of fit | Gradient descent | Learning models | Learning performance | Machine learning methods | Publicly accessible | Random forest modeling,"Aderemi O Adewumi and Andronicus A Akinyelu. 2017.

To identify the range of methods governments used to address COVID-19 misinformation, we conducted a content analysis of international media and evaluated government actions in light of international law, which protects freedom of expression and calls on governments to guarantee this fundamental right even during a pandemic or other emergency. We identified five categories of government activities: (1) disseminating and increasing access to accurate information; (2) restricting access to accurate information; (3) disseminating disinformation, false information, and misinformation; (4) addressing commercial fraud; and (5) criminalizing expression. The goal of addressing COVID-19 misinformation is best served by protecting expression, disseminating factual information, ensuring strong protections for whistleblowers, and supporting an independent media environment.

Aside from the extraordinary impact on society and business as a whole, the pandemic generated a set of unique cyber-crime related circumstances which also affected society and business. The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyber-attacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyber-attacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyber-attack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, three or four unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged salient events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and execute cyber-crime campaigns.",Attack timeline | Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Cyber security | Cyber-attack | Cyber-crime | Home working,Attack timeline | Case-studies | Coronaviruses | COVID-19 | Cyber security | Cyber-attacks | Cybercrime | Home working | Modus operandi | Paper analysis,"Abrams, L., 2020.

People's hard-earned money, their personal information, identity, and health are at a higher risk than ever due to the misuse of technology in doing forgery. However, the technology can also be used as an answer to counteracting against fraudulence prevalent in affairs from every walk of life. This short paper attempts to present the blockchain technology as a solution to overcome the menace of forgery by promoting trustless computing in business transactions. The paper explains the blockchain technology and a variety of its implementation through five different use cases in the field of drug supply chain, health insurance, land record management, courier services, and immigration records. The immigration blockchain is also proposed as a solution to check pandemic like the coronavirus (COVID-19) effectively. The implementation of the Blockchain is performed using a locally built IBM’s hyper-ledger fabric-based platform, and Ethereum public platform. The results are encouraging enough to substitute existing business operations using Blockchain-based solutions.",Blockchain | COVID-19 | Proof of work | Trustless computing,,"Jaeger LG (2018) Public versus private: What to know before getting started with blockchain.

While e-pharmacy businesses were initially the preserve of high-income countries, in the past decade they have been growing rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Public health concerns associated with e-pharmacy include the sale of prescription-only medicines without a prescription and the sale of substandard and falsified medicines. There are also non-health-related risks such as consumer fraud and lack of data privacy. However, e-pharmacy may also have the potential to improve access to medicines. Drawing on existing literature and a set of key informant interviews in Kenya, Nigeria and India, we examine the e-pharmacy regulatory systems in LMICs. None of the study countries had yet enacted a regulatory framework specific to e-pharmacy. Key regulatory challenges included the lack of consensus on regulatory models, lack of regulatory capacity, regulating sales across borders and risks of over-regulation. However, e-pharmacy also presents opportunities to enhance medicine regulation - through consolidation in the sector, and the traceability and transparency that online records offer. The regulatory process needs to be adapted to keep pace with this dynamic landscape and exploit these possibilities. This will require exploration of a range of innovative regulatory options, collaboration with larger, more compliant businesses, and engagement with global regulatory bodies. A key first step must be ensuring that national regulators are equipped with the necessary awareness and technical expertise to actively oversee this e-pharmacy activity.",health policy | health systems | public health | qualitative study,,"Coherent Market Insights.

On-site source data verification (SDV) in the multicenter clinical trial became difficult due to travel ban and social distancing. For multicenter clinical trials, centralized data monitoring is an efficient and cost-effective method of data monitoring. Centralized data monitoring reduces the risk of COVID-19 infections and provides additional capabilities compared to on-site monitoring. The key steps for on-site monitoring include identifying key risk factors and thresholds for the risk factors, developing a monitoring plan, following up the risk factors, and providing a management plan to mitigate the risk. Methods: For analysis purposes, we simulated data similar to our clinical trial data. We classified the data monitoring process into two groups, such as the Supervised analysis process, to follow each patient remotely by creating a dashboard and an Unsupervised analysis process to identify data discrepancy, data error, or data fraud. We conducted several risk-based statistical analysis techniques to avoid on-site source data verification to reduce time and cost, followed up with each patient remotely to maintain social distancing, and created a centralized data monitoring dashboard to ensure patient safety and maintain the data quality. Conclusion: Data monitoring in clinical trials is a mandatory process. A risk-based centralized data review process is cost-effective and helpful to ignore on-site data monitoring at the time of the pandemic. We summarized how different statistical methods could be implemented and explained in SAS to identify various data error or fabrication issues in multicenter clinical trials.",Centralize data monitoring | Risk based data monitoring,Change Management | Clinical Trials as Topic | Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees | Communicable Disease Control | Cost-Benefit Analysis | COVID-19 | Data Accuracy | Humans | Multicenter Studies as Topic | Research Design | Risk Adjustment | Risk Assessment | Risk Management | SARS-CoV-2 | Travel-Related Illness,"Baigent, C., Harrell, F.E., Buyse, M., Emberson, J.R., Altman, D.G., Ensuring trial validity by data quality assurance and diversification of monitoring methods.

To evade the spread of contamination Individuals are urged to cover their faces using a mask when in open territory. The utilization of these face veils makes the orthodox facial recognition system inadequate for authentication in school/office participation, face access control, facial participation, facial security checks at airport and train stations, etc. The recent progressed deep learning-based face acknowledgment approaches rely upon countless training samples and significant features of the entire face. This paper addresses the issue of recognition of face and veil using Gabor wavelet and deep transfer learning. Here the Gabor wavelet features are extracted from the non-masked region of the face and integrated with deep learned CNN features to generate a more robust feature vector for optimizing recognition. The proposed method is experimented on 4 benchmark datasets and a manually prepared dates and achieved averaged 97% recognition accuracy.",Deep Learning | Face Mask Recognition | Face recognition | Fraud detection | Gabor wavelet | Masked face detection | Transfer learning,Benchmark datasets | Facial recognition systems | Feature vectors | Fraud prevention | Gabor wavelet features | Recognition accuracy | Security checks | Training sample,"https://www. worldometers. info/coronavirus/ ; Qiting Ye, Masked Face Detection Via a Novel Framework, Advances in Engineering Research, volume 149 780, 2nd International Conference on Mechanical, Electronic, Control and Automation Engineering (MECAE 2018) ; Manoharan, Samuel.

We also investigate impacts of the opening of four new light rail stations in 2016 and of increased community-based policing starting in late 2018. Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes-larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property-and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: Citywide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new community- based policing measures. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions. While our research detects changes in reported crime, it does not provide causative explanations. Our work, along with other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, may be useful to law enforcement and policymakers to assess the overall effect of Proposition 47.",,California | Crime | Humans | Law Enforcement | Legislation as Topic,"Ballotpedia.

"Emara N. , Zhang Y.","56073208000 , 57222079644",The non-linear impact of digitization on remittances inflow: Evidence from the BRICS,2021,Telecommunications Policy,45,4,102112,,,,1,10.1016/j.telpol.2021.102112,,"Due to the impact of COVID-19, it is important now more than ever to analyze the relationship between the improvement in digitization and the flow of remittances in order to fill the void that has come as a result of stay at home and quarantine orders. Using a comprehensive measure of digitization that encompasses the commonly used proxies of financial technology (Fintech) and employing a System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) panel estimation methodology on annual data over the period 2004–2018, this paper examines the impact of digitization, as a proxy of Fintech, on the inflow of remittances for a sample of 34 developed and developing countries. Our analysis provides an interesting case study on Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), known as five emerging markets with a great number of workers out of abroad but below the average level of digital transfers. Using the Digital Ecosystem Development Index developed by Katz and Callorda (2018), the results of the paper uncover a statistically significant nonlinear relationship between the improvement in digitization measures and the inflow of remittances with an exact threshold level. More specifically, our results indicate that improvement in digitization may initially increase the remittances inflow leading to an increase in the stock of remittances received. Nevertheless, once the digitization index reaches its threshold level further improvement in digitization tends decrease as penetration increases, giving rise to a decline in the rate of remittances inflow. This result implies that the marginal effect of the digital penetration is larger when at its lower level, before the threshold level. For countries such as the BRICS, with a level of digitization below the average of our sample, policy makers should apply more aggressive and comprehensive policies to recoup the maximum gains of a digital ecosystem. Hence, our policy implications are directed towards increasing the investments in developing human capacity including carrying different skill development training programs to prepare individuals for the information age, expanding the internet coverage and speed especially in educational establishments, encouraging the use and access of electronic banking by consumers, producers, and governments, and taking cyber security and fraud protection more seriously to encourage the flow of remittances, especially in light of its renewed utility due to the recent pandemic.",BRICS | Digitization | Financial inclusion | FinTech | Remittances,Digital ecosystem | Educational establishments | Electronic banking | Estimation methodologies | Generalized method of moments | Non-linear impact | Non-linear relationships | Policy implications,"Aggarwal, R., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Martínez-Pería, M., Do remittances promote financial development?.

However, emergency situations allow the mitigation of the effects of certain rules and procedures, which may hinder actions facing the crisis. This article seeks, through bibliographic research and documentary study, to analyze the impacts of the decree of public calamity in the country, due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, evaluating the consequences of possible flexibility of procedures and rules, extremely necessary to control management, as in the case of the ones dealing with transparency and access to information. It is understood that, in order to maintain fundamental rights and guarantees, as well as the transparency of public management acts, in spite of the flexibility of control rules, exceptional situations demand their expansion, so that society and authorities can follow, even better, public activities, due to the increased risk of diversion, fraud and corruption. In this sense, it is the case to think about the pertinence and importance of the application of integrity programs in the direct public administration, which allow the maintenance of controls, in a systematic way, even in exceptional situations. The present study is justified by the need to deepen studies related to the effectiveness of Brazilian public management control mechanisms, as well as by the great repercussion and interest of the theme in the current context of the epidemiological crisis.",Compliance | COVID-19 | Information Access | Pandemic | Public Calamity | Transparence,,"ALI, Shajeea Arshad et al.

Telehealth and telemedicine systems aim to deliver remote healthcare services to mitigate the spread of COVID-9. Also, they can help to manage scarce healthcare resources to control the massive burden of COVID-19 patients in hospitals. However, a large portion of today's telehealth and telemedicine systems are centralized and fall short of providing necessary information security and privacy, operational transparency, health records immutability, and traceability to detect frauds related to patients’ insurance claims and physician credentials. Methods. The current study has explored the potential opportunities and adaptability challenges for blockchain technology in telehealth and telemedicine sector. It has explored the key role that blockchain technology can play to provide necessary information security and privacy, operational transparency, health records immutability, and traceability to detect frauds related to patients’ insurance claims and physician credentials. Results. Blockchain technology can improve telehealth and telemedicine services by offering remote healthcare services in a manner that is decentralized, tamper-proof, transparent, traceable, reliable, trustful, and secure. It enables health professionals to accurately identify frauds related to physician educational credentials and medical testing kits commonly used for home-based diagnosis. Conclusions. Wide deployment of blockchain in telehealth and telemedicine technology is still in its infancy. Several challenges and research problems need to be resolved to enable the widespread adoption of blockchain technology in telehealth and telemedicine systems.",Blockchain | COVID-19 | Security | Smart contracts | Telehealth | Telemedicine,Health professionals | Healthcare resources | Healthcare services | Insurance claims | Research problems | Telemedicine services | Telemedicine systems | Telemedicine technology | Blockchain | COVID-19 | Electronic Health Records | Humans | SARS-CoV-2 | Technology | Telemedicine,"Azim, A., Islam, M.N., Spranger, P.E., Blockchain and novel coronavirus: towards preventing Ltdc:COVID-19:rtdc and future pandemics.

Cultivation effects and protective motivations,2021,Government Information Quarterly,38,2,101572,,,,6,10.1016/j.giq.2021.101572,,"Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak and offering COVID-19-related scams to unsuspecting people. Currently, there is a lack of studies that focus on protecting people from COVID-19-related cybercrimes. Drawing upon Cultivation Theory and Protection Motivation Theory, we develop a research model to examine the cultivation effect of government social media on peoples' information security behavior towards COVID-19 scams. We employ structural equation modeling to analyze 240 survey responses collected from social media followers of government accounts. Our results suggest that government social media account followers' participation influences their information security behavior through perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, and response efficacy. Our study highlights the importance of government social media for information security management during crises.",COVID-19 | Cultivation theory | Cybercrime | Government social media | Information security | Protection motivation theory,,"Anderson, C.L., Agarwal, R., Practicing safe computing: A multimedia empirical examination of home computer user security behavioral intentions.

This commodity is highly vulnerable to fraud, especially in the post COVID-19 era. A unique two-tiered analytical system comprised of rapid on-site screening of samples using handheld portable Near-infrared NIR and laboratory confirmatory technique using a Head space gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) strategy for untargeted analysis was developed. Chemometric models built using NIR data correctly predicted nearly 100% of Pusa 1121 and Taraori, two high value types of Basmati, from potential adulterants. Furthermore, rice VOC profile fingerprints showed very good classification (R2 >0.9, Q2 > 0.9, Accuracy > 0.99) for these high quality Basmati varieties from potential adulterant varieties with aldehydes identified as key VOC marker compounds. Using a two-tiered system of a rapid method for on-site screening of many samples alongside a laboratory-based confirmatory method can classify Basmati rice varieties, protecting the supply chain from fraud.",Adulteration | Basmati rice | Chemometrics | Fraud | GC-MS | Handheld | NIR | Two-tiered method,Analytical systems | Chemometric models | Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry | Marker compounds | Near Infrared | Rapid method | Site screening | Tiered System | COVID-19 | Food Analysis | Fraud | Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry | Humans | India | Oryza | Pandemics | Reproducibility of Results | SARS-CoV-2 | Volatile Organic Compounds,"Lantin, R., FAO.

In Chicago, the numbers of crime fell considerably. This work aims to investigate the impacts that COVID-19 has had on the spatial and temporal patterns of crime in Chicago through spatial and temporal crime analyses approaches. The Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) was used to identify the temporal trends of different crimes, detect the outliers of crime events, and examine the periodic variations of crime distributions. The results showed a certain phase pattern in the trend components of assault, battery, fraud, and theft. The largest outlier occurred on 31 May 2020 in the remainder components of burglary, criminal damage, and robbery. The spatial point pattern test (SPPT) was used to detect the similarity between the spatial distribution patterns of crime in 2020 and those in 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, and to analyze the local changes in crime on a micro scale. It was found that the distributions of crime significantly changed in 2020 and local changes in theft, battery, burglary, and fraud displayed an aggregative cluster downtown. The results all claim that spatial and temporal patterns of crime changed significantly affected by COVID-19 in Chicago, and they offer constructive suggestions for local police departments or authorities to allocate their available resources in response to crime.",Crime | Pandemics | Spatial temporal analysis | SPPT | STL,,"Yang, C.

There is consensus in the media and academic journals alike, that cybercrimes have incremented over the years. During the coronavirus pandemic in the year 2020, a global lockdown imposed by governments forced people to be homebound, leading to a subsequent surge in online users. This resulted in cybersecurity risk hitting close to home, with an upsurge in cybercrimes. This article attempts to make sense of the elevated cybercrime landscape. For the last two decades, criminological research have attempted to explore variants of technology-enabled crime and have examined theories to account for offending. This study proposes ‘Routine Activity Theory’ to explain the magnitude of cybercrimes during this unprecedented period that reshaped people’s routine lifestyles. Routine activity theory predicts that changes in opportunity situations (increase in online users), potentially escalates the convergence of motivated offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardianship. Guardianship (security measures) is pivotal in this theory, to protect the targets (online users) from offenders (cyber threat actors). Furthermore, this paper offers practical security measures, in light of the specified cyber-attacks during this unprecedented period. If this theory is empirically validated, it offers opportunities to mitigate the extent of cybercrimes with an upsurge of online users, and more so for cybercrimes in general.",,Academic journal | Coronaviruses | Cyber security | Cyber threats | Cyber-attacks | Cyber-crimes | Routine activity theories | Security measure,"Leukfeldt E R and Yar M 2016 Applying Routine Activity Theory to Cybercrime: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis Deviant Behavior 37 263–80 ; Kigerl A 2012 Routine Activity Theory and the Determinants of High Cybercrime Countries Social Science Computer Review 470–86 ; Bendovschi A 2015 Cyber-Attacks – Trends, Patterns and Security Countermeasures Procedia Economics and Finance 24–39 ; Interpol 2018 Cyberattacks know no borders and evolve at a rapid pace https://www.interpol.int/Crimes/Cybercrime/COVID-19-cyberthreats ; Miller S, Wagner C, Aickelin U and Garibaldi J M 2016 Modelling cyber-security experts’ decision making processes using aggregation operators Computers and Security 62229–45 ; Lagazio M, Sherif N and Cushman M 2014 A multi-level approach to understanding the impact of cyber crime on the financial sector Computers and Security 45 58–74 ; Smith K T, Jones A, Johnson L and Smith L M 2019 Examination of cybercrime and its effects on corporate stock value Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society 17 42–60 ; Willison R, Warkentin M and Johnston A C 2018 Examining employee computer abuse intentions: insights from justice, deterrence and neutralization perspectives Information Systems Journal 28 266–93 ; Niemimaa M and Niemimaa E 2019 Abductive innovations in information security policy development: an ethnographic study European Journal of Information Systems 28566–89 ; Operations C T 2020 Cyber Threats 2019: A Year in Retrospect https://www.itweb.co.za/content/JBwErvn5wg2q6Db2 ; EC - Council 2019 MOST COMMON CYBERATTACKS OF 2019 Q4 ; Winder D 2019 The Top 10 Cybersecurity Stories Of 2019—A Window Onto The 2020 Threatscape https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/12/27/the-top-10-cybersecuritystories-of-2019-a-window-onto-the-2020-threatscape/#7d6846087992 ; PwC 2020 Behaviourally-inspired measures to lower the risk of cyber-attacks in your organisation https://www.pwc.co.za/en/press-room/cyber-attacks.html ; Interpol 2020 https://www.interpol.int/Crimes/Cybercrime/COVID-19-cyberthreats?cv=1 ; PwC 2020 How to manage the impact of COVID-19 on cyber security https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/crisis-and-resilience/covid-19/how-to-manage-the-impact-ofcovid-19-on-cyber-security.html ; FBI National Press Office 2020 FBI and CISA Warn Against Chinese Targeting of COVID-19 Research Organizations https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-and-cisa-warn-against-chinese-targetingof- covid-19-research-organizations ; Smith R G and Grabosky P N 2001 Online Securities Fraud Journal of FinancialCrime ; Cohen L E and Felson M 1979 Social Change and Crime Rate Trends: A Routine Activity Approach American Sociological Review 44 588–608 ; Marcum C D, Higgins G E and Ricketts M L 2010 Potential factors of online victimization of youth: An examination of adolescent online behaviors utilizing routine activity theory Deviant Behavior 31 381–410 ; Yar M 2005 The Novelty of ‘Cybercrime’: An Assessment in Light of Routine Activity Theory European Journal of Criminology 2 407–27 ; Choo K K 2011 The cyber threat landscape: Challenges and future research directions Computers & security 719-31. ; Jansen J and Leukfeldt R 2016 Phishing and malware attacks on online banking customersin the Netherlands: A qualitative analysis of factors leading to victimization International Journal of Cyber Criminology ; Pratt T C, Holtfreter K and Reisig M D 2010 Routine online activity and internet fraud targeting: Extending the generality of routine activity theory Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 47 267–96 ; Newman G R and Clarke R V 2013 Superhighway robbery: Preventing e-commerce crime ; Clarke R V. 1995 Situational Crime Prevention Crime and Justice 91–150",Conference Paper,,1,130053,2-s2.0-85103232348,17426596 17426588,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103232348&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103232348&origin=inward

Current trends in the development of socio-economic processes aim at building the digital economy and society, but the spread of COVID-19 has exposed the major problems related to these processes. Problem Statement. The pandemic has defined a new fundamental and applied problem regarding the need to study crisis phenomena at the intersection of the number of research areas and their impact on economy and society. Purpose. The purpose is to analyze the state of the development and implementation of digital services in the country under the influence of quarantine restrictions. Materials and Methods. State legislative acts and statistical information have been selected as the information base. A number of methods of scientific inquiry have been applied: theoretical generalization, empirical analysis, comparison, abstraction, etc. Results. It has been defined that majority of the priority areas of digital economy development is being formed and not ready for their massive use. In particular, there still exists a significant inequality of access to digital services, the digital competency training system remains unregulated, the digital job creation scheme in the real economy is almost undeveloped, there are significant gaps in the digital public security services, the problem of the national digital educational platforms has not been resolved yet, the system of provision of remote healthcare services has not been formed, and the procedures for estimating tourist migration and for remote financial services have not been settled. Several problems that aggravated during the pandemic have been studied: the imperfection of social protection procedures, the existence of hidden unemployment, the activation of cybercrime, the aggravation of individual psychological problems, extremely high level of dependence on reliability of the network services. The directions for increasing financial results in the pandemic conditions have been identified. Conclusions. The pandemic has identified bottlenecks in the processes of the digital economy and society formation and allowed determining the priority areas in research and practical actions in order to adapt rapidly to new conditions.",Development | Digital economy | Pandemic | Problems,,"The purposes of a sustainable development 2016—2030.

Approaching Democracy provides students with a framework to analyze the structure, process, and action of US government, institutions, and social movements. It also invites comparison with other countries. This globalizing perspective gives students an understanding of issues of governance and challenges to democracy here and elsewhere. At a moment of growing domestic terrorism, political hyper-partisanship, populism, identity politics, and governmental dysfunction, there is no better time to bring Approaching Democracy--a textbook based on Vaclav Havel’s powerful metaphor of democracy as an ideal and the American experiment as the closest approach to it--to a new generation of political science undergraduate students. NEW TO THE NINTH EDITION •Two new authors, Nadia E. Brown and Sarah Allen Gershon, who bring refreshing intellectual and diverse perspectives to the text. •Includes the tumultuous political context surrounding the Trump presidency, the 2020 elections, the 116th Congress, the Supreme Court, the COVID-19 crisis, and the fight for social and racial justice. •Figures and tables reflect the latest available data and surveys. •Two new features--Diversity and Democracy, highlighting the experiences of America’s diverse social groups and the role of identity politics?and Discussion Questions at the end of each chapter, assessing critical thinking skills. •Critical contemporary events are explored throughout the book, including the attempted coup following the 2020 elections, the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter, protests in American cities that come to the epicenter of America’s approach to democracy, the changes in the Supreme Court and the federal court system, the growth of LGBTQ+ legal rights, and the alteration in American Federalism. New and updated data on public attitudes toward police brutality, DACA, voter suppression, healthcare, and the global climate movement are also covered.",,,"Congressional Record-House, February21, 1990, pp. H392-H395. ; Anthony Salvanto, Kabir Khanna, Fred Backus and Jennifer De Pinto, “Americans See Democracy Under Threat -CBS News Poll, "" CBS, January 17, 2021, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-coronavirus-opinion-poll/. ; Heather Cox Richardson, “The President’s Personal Militia, "" Moyers on Democracy, July 23, 2020, for source of all quotations in the paragraph. ; Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (first published 1835-1840).

Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P ? 0.05. The respondents' mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD ± 3.0) and 24.1 (SD ± 2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels. However, relatively lower proportions showed adherence to avoid touching face or nose (19.5%), face mask-wearing (58.1%), and social distancing (57.4%). Being in the 6th year of study (OR = 3.18, 95%CI: 1.62-6.26, P = 0.001) and female (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.11-4.41, P = 0.024) were significant positive predictors of good knowledge and satisfactory practices, respectively. While only 30% of the respondents perceived the pandemic as a scam or a disease of the elites (24.0%), the respondents were worried about their academics being affected negatively (55.6%). Veterinary Medical Students in Nigeria had good knowledge and satisfactory preventive practices towards COVID-19; albeit with essential gaps in the key non-pharmaceutical preventive measures recommended by the WHO. Therefore, there is a need to step up enlightenment and targeted campaigns about COVID-19 pandemic.",,"Adult | COVID-19 | Cross-Sectional Studies | Education, Veterinary | Female | Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice | Humans | Male | Masks | Nigeria | Physical Distancing | Quarantine | SARS-CoV-2 | Self Report | Students, Medical | Surveys and Questionnaires | Young Adult","World Health Organisation (WHO) Dashboard, 2020.

An estimated 30% of some populations subscribe some form of COVID medico-scientific conspiracy narratives, with detrimental impacts for themselves and others. Consequently, exposing the lack of veracity of these claims is of considerable importance. Previous work has demonstrated that historical medical and scientific conspiracies are highly unlikely to be sustainable. In this article, an expanded model for a hypothetical en masse COVID conspiracy is derived. Analysis suggests that even under ideal circumstances for conspirators, commonly encountered conspiratorial claims are highly unlikely to endure, and would quickly be exposed. This work also explores the spectrum of medico-scientific acceptance, motivations behind propagation of falsehoods, and the urgent need for the medical and scientific community to anticipate and counter the emergence of falsehoods.",,COVID-19 | Deception | Electromagnetic Fields | Fraud | Humans | SARS-CoV-2 | Truth Disclosure | Vaccination | Wireless Technology,"Poland GA, Jacobson RM, et al.

Methods: It was a comparative cross sectional study, conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Al- Imam University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 30, 2020. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect the data from students and staff about conventional teaching, online teaching, conventional examination and online examination. It was in the form of 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 5-strongly agree, to 1-strongly disagree, in addition to age and gender. The results of conventional and online examination were recorded. Results: The total sample reached 230 students and 20 staff. Mean scores for conventional teaching and examination were significantly higher than online. The mean values for grades of online final examination was significantly higher than those of midterm conventional examination. Most of the statements related to conventional teaching and examination attained a good response where students and their staff conveyed a negative perception pertinent to online examination. Students and staff showed a higher percentage of agreement in favor of online examination allowing immediate feedback. Conclusion: Conventional teaching was perceived as more effective, accessible, less technical difficulties and less fraud and cheating. Online learning, should be allowed in undergraduate medical education, by combining it with conventional learning, and students should be prepared to it.",Basic medical science | College of medicine | COVID 19 | Ordinary and online teaching,"Academic Performance | Attitude | COVID-19 | Cross-Sectional Studies | Education, Distance | Education, Medical, Undergraduate | Female | Humans | Male | Pandemics | Perception | SARS-CoV-2 | Saudi Arabia | Students, Medical | Young Adult","Singha T.

The work suggests that during the lockdown, more than a shift of criminals from physical space to cyberspace, what has existed is, on the one hand, an adaptation of cybercriminals to the new opportunities for crime that were emerging in the context of Covid-19, and, on the other hand, a shift of opportunities to cyberspace as a result of the increased time and activities carried out on the Internet that could have effectively led to an increase in some cybercrimes. It is argued that this negative correlation of trends, of reduced crime on the streets and increased crime in cyberspace, is directly related to the shift in everyday activities resulting from digitisation, which has been taking place for decades. The Covid-19 crisis thus appears to be more than a cause but an accelerator of this process, and it is important to consider how this will affect future crime trends.",Adaptation of cybercrime | Crime trends | Criminal opportunity | Cybercrime | Displacement,,"ABRAMS, D.

Karpoff J.M.,6603007110,The future of financial fraud,2021,Journal of Corporate Finance,66,,101694,,,,4,10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101694,,"Is financial fraud becoming a bigger or smaller problem over time? Current empirical approaches to this question generate mixed inferences. As an alternative, I use two theoretical constructs that isolate several factors that motivate fraud, and use them to consider the impact of technological and wealth changes over time. Some changes, such as an increase in anonymity in some financial transactions, facilitate new fraud innovations and increase the possibility of fraud. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic shutdown has fostered major disruptions in relative demands and organizational capital that also increase the likelihood of fraud over the next few years. Viewed over a longer time scale, however, the majority of technological and wealth changes seem likely to increase the use and effectiveness of reputational capital, third-party enforcement, and ethical motivations as fraud deterrents. I predict that, on net, these changes will drive a long-term decrease in the incidence of fraud.",Financial misconduct | Fraud | Reputation | Trust,,"Akerlof, G., The market for ‘lemons’: quality uncertainty and the market mechanism.

After almost 14 years in power, the government of Bolivia’s first indigenous president collapsed in 2019 amidst widescale protest and allegations of electoral fraud. The contested transitional government that emerged was quickly struck by the impacts of the Covid-19 public health crisis. This book reflects on this critical moment in Bolivia’s development from the perspectives of politics, the economy, the judiciary and the environment. It asks what key issues emerged during Evo Morales’s administration and what are the main challenges awaiting the next government in order to steer the country through a new and uncertain road ahead. As the world considers what the ultimate legacy of Morales’s left-wing social experiment will be, this book will be of great interest to researchers across the fields of Latin American studies, development, politics, and economics, as well as to professionals active in the promotion of development in the country and the region.",,,,Book,,0,21101044533,2-s2.0-85105162552,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105162552&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105162552&origin=inward
Schofield M.,7004498916,Regulatory and legislative issues on telehealth,2021,Nutrition in Clinical Practice,,,,,,,0,10.1002/ncp.10740,,"The use of telehealth to deliver health care services in the United States experienced rapid expansion with the advent of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) and associated waivers. Prior to the pandemic, adoption of telehealth by health care providers was hampered by outdated legislative and regulatory barriers at the federal and state levels. This paper provides a review of the legislative and regulatory landscape for telehealth in the United States and how it has changed during the COVID-10 PHE. It remains to be seen whether the temporary flexibilities surrounding delivery and payment of telehealth services will remain in place; some require Congressional action to make permanent while others can be made permanent through rulemaking. Other actions are dependent on state legislatures and commercial payers. Issues under debate by stakeholders include long-term audio-only coverage; broadband connectivity; disparities in access to telehealth; appropriate payment for telehealth versus in-person care; concerns about fraud, quality, and safety; and the need for additional data to inform future policymaking. Insights are provided into these key issues that are expected to shape future legislative and regulatory action at the federal and state levels. Health care providers and patients need to engage in advocacy work at the federal and state level, and with commercial payers, to affect meaningful long-term change.",nutrition support practice | public policy | reimbursement,,"Encyclopedia Britannica.

Warikandwa T.V.,57193852314,Personal data security in south africa's financial services market: The protection of personal information act 4 of 2013 and the european union general data protection regulation compared,2021,Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal,24,,,,,,0,10.17159/1727-3781/2021/v24i0a10727,,"The contemporary global financial services market has witnessed a substantial increase in cybercrime which places consumers' personal data at risk. Rapid increases in cybercrime linked to the financial services market have driven financial market regulators to pass novel laws and regulations aimed at curbing the rate of occurrence of cybercrimes connected to personal data sharing. To that end, banks and/or financial services companies in Europe have swiftly moved to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Whilst personal data protection regulation is not a new concept in Europe, most African countries (with exception of South Africa) do not have laws and regulations on personal data protection. With the financial services market being extremely vulnerable to cyber risks owing to the digitisation of the financial services sector, it is important to assess the suitability of South Africa's current regulatory framework concerning the protection of personal data. This article thus examines South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 with a view to ascertaining its suitability and/or adequacy in protecting personal data in the country's financial services market. With the global Covid-19 pandemic bringing about concerns related to rapid increases in cyber-attacks in the financial services market owing to the increased sharing of the sensitive personal data of consumers, there is also need to test the POPIA's conformity with the strict European Union GDPR personal data protection guidelines.",Cybercrime | Data protection | European Union General Data Protection Regulation | Financial regulators | Financial services market | Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013,,"Akinbowale, Klingehofer and Zerihun 2020 JFC Akinbowale OE, Klingehofer, HE and Zerihun MF ""Analysis of Cyber-crime Effects on the Banking Sector Using the Balanced Score Card: A Survey of Literature"" 2020 JFC 945-958 ; Alshubiri, Jamil and Elheddad 2019 IJEBM Alshubiri F, Jamil SA and Elheddad M ""The Impact of ICT on Financial Development: Empirical Evidence from the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries"" 2019 IJEBM 1-14 ; Boer and Vazquez Cyber Security and Financial Stability Boer M and Vazquez J Cyber Security and Financial Stability: How Cyber-attacks could Materially Impact the Global Financial System (Institute of International Finance Washington DC 2017) ; DTTL 2012 DTTL Global Financial Services Industry Security Study Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited 2012 DTTL Global Financial Services Industry Security Study (Deloitte Global Services Limited New York 2012) ; Dupont 2019 J Cybersecur Dupont B ""The Cyber-resilience of Financial Institutions: Significance and Applicability"" 2019 J Cybersecur 1-17 ; FRA Handbook on European Data Protection Law European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights Handbook on European Data Protection Law (Publications Office of the European Union Luxembourg 2018) ; Fuster Emergence of Personal Data Protection Fuster GG The Emergence of Personal Data Protection as a Fundamental Right of the EU (Springer Cham 2014) ; Hernandez de Cos ""Financial Technology"" Hernandez de Cos P ""Financial Technology: The 150-year Revolution"" Keynote address delivered at the 22nd Euro Finance Week (19 November 2019 Frankfurt) 1-11 ; Hoofnagle 2018 EuCML Hoofnagle C ""Designing for Consent"" 2018 EuCML 162-171 ; Hoofnagle, Van der Sloot and ZuiderveenBorgesius 2019 ICTL Hoofnagle CJ, Van der Sloot B and ZuiderveenBorgesius F ""The European Union General Data Protection Regulation: What it is and What it Means"" 2019 ICTL 65-98 ; Jang-Jaccard and Nepal 2014 JCSS Jang-Jaccard J and Nepal S ""A Survey of Emerging Threats in Cybersecurity"" 2014 JCSS 973-993 ; Rodotà ""Data Protection as Fundamental Human Right"" Rodotà S ""Data Protection as Fundamental Human Right"" in Gutwirth S et al (eds) Reinventing Data Protection?

Cybercriminals always try to exploit any crisis to facilitate their attacks, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic is not an exception. From the very first beginning of the COVID-19 virus outbreak in March 2020, it has become very effective tool to commit cybercrimes as it has not only triggered huge upheavals in health, education, and the economy but has also led to broad implications on communication and information technology as well. In line with the increasing number and scope of cyberattacks, the growing concern caused by the pandemic has increased the possibility of successful cyberattacks. The significance of this paper is to highlight and review some types of cyberattacks associated with the COVID-19 presence. In addition, the paper recommends some guidelines and countermeasures for the micro-level of families, individuals and for business enterprise to implement potential means of risk management plans to actively mitigate and control the consequences of such malicious attacks.",COVID-19 | Cyberattacks | Cybercrime | Cybersecurity | Risk Management,,"C.

As influential information sources, mainstream news media have a unique opportunity to use their platform to debunk and educate the public about misinformation. Despite evidence lending support to the potential for mainstream news media to play a larger role in combating misinformation in society, empirical explorations of how they have contributed to the management of misinformation remain scant. This study aims to address these major gaps in research by investigating how mainstream news dailies gatekeep and correct COVID-19 related misinformation in Singapore. The content of 164 news articles published by the mainstream news dailies in Singapore from January 1 to April 30, 2020 on COVID-19 misinformation was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results show that the two main types of misinformation, fabricated and reconfigured misinformation, were covered almost equally by mainstream news media. Misinformation related to science and health were most frequently reported, followed by scams, and government policy. Statistically significant differences were found between how mainstream news media corrected the various types and topics of misinformation. Significant differences were also found within the various types, topics, and corrections of misinformation across the early stages of the pandemic. Taken together, these findings shed light on the critical role of mainstream news media as public education tools to correct misinformation during public health crises. From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the understanding of media misinformation gatekeeping, and misinformation correction. From a practical perspective, it highlights the capacity and potential roles of the press in supporting government efforts to combat misinformation.",,,"Baker, H. K., & Puttonen, V., (2019).

"Krambia Kapardis M. , Spanoudis G.","12759600000 , 7801438113",Lessons learned during Covid-19 concerning cheating in e-examinations by university students,2021,Journal of Financial Crime,,,,,,,0,10.1108/JFC-05-2021-0105,,"Purpose: The researchers aim to investigate how students can be deterred from cheating, whether legal or ethical policies and procedures are effective and whether there are gender differences. Design/methodology/approach: Using data on students undertaking midterm and final e-examinations, as well as a control group of students who were caught cheating in an online mid-semester examination, the authors attempt to answer the research questions. Findings: No differences were found in cheating in terms of students’ gender or whether they were repeating a course or not. However, the study revealed that if there are more internal controls imposed and if before the examination students are made to reinforce their academic integrity, e-examination cheating is reduced. Originality/value: No other published study was carried out with students who were involved in cheating.",Academic integrity | Cheating | Covid-19 | e-examination | Fraud,,"ACCC (2021), “Current COVID-19 scams”, available at: www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/current-covid-19-coronavirus-scams (accessed 21 April 2021). ; Apampa, K.M., Wills, G. and Argles, D.

Due to the increased presence of technology, cybercrime is on the rise and the number of cyber-attacks has increased significantly, this has made data mining techniques an important factor in detecting security threats. This research proposes that Classification techniques can be used to reliably classify and predict cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a classification framework using data collected from Hackmagedon, a blog which contains timelines and statistics for cyber-attacks. The dataset includes cyber-attacks which occurred between 2017 and 2019 within countries in Europe. The purpose of this research is to investigate how Classification techniques can be used to better understand and predict future cyber-attacks. Different Classification techniques will be applied to the dataset to determine which technique produces the most accurate results. The model will be validated using a dataset containing COVID-19 cyber-attacks from Hackmagedon.",COVID-19 | Cyber attack | OSI | Pandemic | Prediction,,"BBC (2020) Coronavirus: cyber-attacks hit hospital construction companies.

As many services move online due to the pandemic, COVID-19-themed cyber fraud is also growing. This article explores cyber fraud victimization and cyber security threats during COVID-19 using psychological and traditional criminological theories. It also provides a COVID-19-themed cyber fraud typology using empirical evidence from institutional and agency reports. Through organizing COVID-19-themed cyber fraud into four different categorizations, we aim to offer classification insights to researchers and industry professionals so that stakeholders can effectively manage emerging cyber fraud risks in our current pandemic.

More than 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found leading to more than 367166 deaths till May 31, 2020. With every passing day, the number of cases and deaths is expanding. The widespread of this epidemic has not only threatened human health but also production, economy, social functioning, education, etc. In this critical pandemic situation, a large number of the population are fighting for their lives and economic challenges for survival. Although digital health would not be the main contributor in combating COVID-19, it could play a very important supporting role in control and prevention work. During this isolation period, various digital applications are needed to ensure a normal life for most of the people. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, big data, cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT) and other digital technologies are playing a vital role in managing routine activities through work from home, online education, remote patient treatment, citizen protection, risk communication, and medical supplies. On the downside, various technical threats like online fraud and cyber-attacks are rising and increasing challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this paper is to explore the available COVID-19 statistics and understand the impacts with technical threats to relief measures in India caused in the current pandemic. To realize social responsibility and comprehend response capacity in foreseeing COVID-19 extortions and foster the community awareness toward population and public health allocation where upholding local health with technical risk prevention is alarming.

With the increase in internet use, the growth in loneliness and the increasing engagement in online dating sites during COVID-19, opportunities for romance fraud may have suffered an important increase. This paper aims to analyse changes in romance fraud, loneliness and internet use during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Data about romance fraud reported to the police in the UK, and survey data recorded by the Understanding Society longitudinal survey, are used to address our research questions. Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling is used to analyse whether temporal changes observed are an effect of social changes associated with lockdown and stay-at-home orders. Findings: The analysis shows that cyber-enabled romance fraud experienced a large increase after April 2020, which is greatly above any expected crime variation considering known pre-COVID trends. The increase in romance fraud was more abrupt among young adults than older persons. The results also indicate that only young adults experienced a significant increase in loneliness, while older adults reported a large increase in internet use during COVID. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind paper analysing the effect of rapid social changes on a growing type of cyber-enabled fraud. It is likely that the growth in romance fraud during COVID is due to a combined effect of an increase in internet use and growing loneliness rates experienced by many people during the pandemic.",Coronavirus | Cybercrime | Dating fraud | Lockdown | Loneliness,,"Abrams, D.S.

The application of new technologies comes with inherent risks of ever-changing cyberspace and increasing cybercrime. Previous research has shown that the human factor remains the core element in the cybersecurity chain. Therefore, it is paramount that employees receive effective training to acquire a security mindset. This study puts forward previous research that resulted in a portable escape room game to raise cybersecurity awareness. The purpose of the study is to elaborate the transformation of the physical game into a virtual learning experience to increase flexibility in times such as the Covid-19 lockdown. As main method, we applied the design science framework of Hevner et al. As main result, the research elaborates the design of the developed artifact-a virtual prototype of the escape room game addressing the cybersecurity challenges of SMEs. For the evaluation of the prototype, empirical data was collected in qualitative and quantitative form. As main conclusions, we have observed that a physical escape room can be transformed into a virtual setting with little means without sacrificing player immersion.

Our electoral institutions survived that test, but the fragility of our democracy was exposed by a concerted effort to overturn the results of the presidential election, first in the courts and then with an insurrection at the nation's Capitol on January 6, 2021. We examine how this happened. Specifically, we will attempt to answer the following questions: How did the big lie evolve and what were its claims? How did the COVID pandemic and foreign interference complicate the voting process and contribute to the claims of fraud? How did the courts adjudicate the claims of fraud? Finally, how do we restore trust in the voting process?.",,,"Aguilera v. Fontes, CV2020-014083, Arizona MaricopaCounty Superior Court, November 4, 2020. ; Ahlquist, John S., Kenneth R.

These participants were selected from various social media platforms and were requested to complete an online survey over a 3-month period. Data were analyzed in three phases: tracking, modeling, and forecasting. We first tracked the respondents’ perceptions in the form of a qualitative response, where seven thematic constructs emerged from content analysis. These constructs were confirmed in the modeling phase, using structural equation modeling after data transformation. The themes were forecast as a single construct to predict possible trends and patterns over the next 3 month period using an autoregressive integrated moving average. Our findings revealed that public perceptions toward the reality of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria fall into seven thematic constructs: “scam,” “fake,” “politics,” “business venture,” “exaggeration,” “real,” and “real but manipulated.” These constructs show a steady trend with a random walk pattern, suggesting that perceptions toward the reality of COVID-19 in Nigeria will remain relatively unchanged over the next 3 month period. We recommend, among other things, that massive and intensive sensitization and awareness programs are needed to change the public mindset concerning the reality of the pandemic in Nigeria.",COVID-19 | modeling | pandemic | public perceptions | tracking,Auto-regressive integrated moving average | Awareness program | Business ventures | Data transformation | Public perception | Qualitative response | Social media platforms | Structural equation modeling,"Akhmetzhanov AR, Mizumoto K, Jung S, et al.

Smith E.M.,55479647100,Reimagining the peer-review system for translational health science journals,2021,Clinical and Translational Science,,,,,,,0,10.1111/cts.13050,,"Retractions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) papers in high impact journals, such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, have been panned as major scientific fraud in public media. The initial reaction to this news was to seek out scapegoats and blame individual authors, peer-reviewers, editors, and journals for wrong doing. This paper suggests that scapegoating a few individuals for faulty science is a myopic approach to the more profound problem with peer-review. Peer-review in its current limited form cannot be expected to adequately address the scope and complexity of large interdisciplinary science research collaboration, which is central in translational research. In addition, empirical studies on the effectiveness of traditional peer-review reveal its very real potential for bias and groupthink; as such, expectations regarding the capacity and effectiveness of the current peer review process are unrealistic. This paper proposes a new vision of peer-review in translational science that, on the one hand, would allow for early release of a manuscript to ensure expediency, whereas also creating a forum or a collective of various experts to actively comment, scrutinize, and even build on the research under review. The aim would be to not only generate open discussion and oversight respecting the quality and limitations of the research, but also to assess the extent and the means for that knowledge to translate into social benefit.",,,"Fry CV, Cai X, Zhang Y, Wagner CS.

The impediment on physical contact and emphasis on social distancing as measures of curbing its spread gave rise to new forms of interactions among individuals. In the ensuing new normal, digital life took the center stage, anchoring engaging and meaningful interactions of individuals in both public and private spheres. This study appraises the adoption of digital life in Nigeria during this period. Hinged on the technological determinism theory, the study examines the sudden digital migration in Nigeria and identifies the factors that facilitated the process, on the one hand, and the obstacles that inhibited it, on the other. Using secondary data derived from books, official websites, and media reports, the study has established that although the Nigerian society adopted digital life as alternative to face-to-face interactions out of expedience, a combination of systemic, structural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors constrained the process with grave implications on the overall (expected) impact to both individual and national developments. The study concludes that effective digitization in Nigeria requires a holistic approach toward addressing germane issues that retard socioeconomic development in the country—such as endemic poverty, structural inequality and class differences, uneven development between urban and rural communities, low computer literacy and information and communications technology (ICTs) access, poor electricity supply, poor global system for mobile communication (GSM) and Internet access, gender factor and vulnerable groups, and digital frauds—in order to create the enabling environment for productive digitization to thrive.",Developing societies | Digital life | Nigeria | Public and private spheres | The new normal: COVID-19,,"Adedigba A., (2020, June 20).

Although this shift increased the efficiency of data processing, it has security drawbacks. Healthcare databases are a precious target for attackers because they facilitate identity theft and cybercrime. This paper presents an approach for database damage assessment for healthcare systems. Inspired by the current behavior of COVID-19 infections, our approach views the damage assessment problem the same way. The malicious transactions will be viewed as if they are COVID-19 viruses, taken from infection onward. The challenge of this research is to discover the infected transactions in a minimal time. The proposed parallel algorithm is based on the transaction dependency paradigm, with a time complexity O((M+NQ+Nˆ3)/L) (M = total number of transactions under scrutiny, N = number of malicious and affected transactions in the testing list, Q = time for dependency check, and L = number of threads used). The memory complexity of the algorithm is O(N+KL) (N = number of malicious and affected transactions, K = number of transactions in one area handled by one thread, and L = number of threads). Since the damage assessment time is directly proportional to the denial-of-service time, the proposed algorithm provides a minimized execution time. Our algorithm is a novel approach that outperforms other existing algorithms in this domain in terms of both time and memory, working up to four times faster in terms of time and with 120,000 fewer bytes in terms of memory.",Damage assessment | Information warfare | Malicious transactions | Transactions dependency,Affected transaction | Current behaviors | Damage assessments | Database damage assessment | Electronic formats | Health-care system | Malicious transaction | Number of threads,"Stapleton, J.J.

Many conservation social scientists are now administering survey questionnaires online, but they must do so while ensuring rigor in data collection. Further, they must address a suite of unique challenges, such as the increasing use of mobile devices by participants and avoiding bots or other survey fraud. We reviewed recent literature on online survey methods to examine the state of the field related to online data collection and dissemination. We illustrate the review with examples of key methodological decisions made during a recent national study of people who feed wild birds, in which survey respondents were recruited through an online panel and a sample generated via a project participant list. Conducting surveys online affords new opportunities for participant recruitment, design, and pilot testing. For instance, online survey panels can provide quick access to large and diverse samples of people. Based on the literature review and our own experiences, we suggest that to ensure high-quality online surveys one should account for potential sampling and nonresponse error, design survey instruments for use on multiple devices, test the instrument, and use multiple protocols to identify data quality problems. We also suggest that research funders, journal editors, and policy makers can all play a role in ensuring high-quality survey data are used to inform effective conservation programs and policies.",ciencias sociales de la conservación | conservation social science | COVID-19 pandemic | cuestionarios | dimensiones humanas | encuestas basadas en la red | human dimensions | methods | métodos | pandemia de COVID-19 | questionnaires | web-based surveys,,"American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR).

"Liu J. , Yan L. , Wang D.","55235418700 , 57222812484 , 57223838608",A Hybrid Blockchain Model for Trusted Data of Supply Chain Finance,2021,Wireless Personal Communications,,,,,,,0,10.1007/s11277-021-08451-x,,"Supply chain finance is an effective way to solve the problem of capital turnover of construction enterprises and stabilize economic growth under epidemic situation. Blockchain technology can solve the problems in the current supply chain finance business, such as incorrect information between banks and enterprises, lack of visibility in transaction process, and possible joint fraud in the core enterprise model. However, it still has problems such as inconvenient information verification, data fraud, and difficulty to achieve a balance between efficiency, security and cost. This paper presents a hybrid chain model combining PANDA (a consensus algorithm based on public chain) and X-Alliance (a consensus algorithm based on alliance chain). Such proposed hybrid chain model can process the transaction of each account in parallel, asynchronize from other unrelated accounts in the network, provide more reliable data storage and authority management, and ensure the ownership of change tracking data, which has higher performance and lower protection cost while ensuring data security and privacy security. According to the data of network crawling, the experimental results show that the throughput can reach 1200tps when four nodes are deployed. The model serves for the supply chain financial data management of engineering projects, making trade authenticity review, risk assessment and credit transmission of core enterprises more efficient. On this basis, each participant can carry out analysis and give early warning of capital flow, timely analyze and calculate the authenticity of transaction background. The proposed method provides a reference for the normal operation of the project fund under the COVID-19 epidemic.",Block chain | Hybrid chain data security | Supply chain finance,Consensus algorithms | Construction enterprise | Data security and privacy | Engineering project | Information verifications | Supply chain finances | Supply chain financials | Transaction process,"Association.

Therefore, most public/private organizations, and even individuals have resorted to the use of diverse Information Technologies (IT) for connecting themselves and other life essentials. Educational, agricultural, religious and even health institutions now deliver their services to users/clients and receive payments via online platforms, students study from home, even employees of most organizations now work remotely (maybe from their homes). Moreover, there is a sharp growth in demand for food deliveries and online grocery. The massive adoption of IT by almost all aspects of human life especially during this epidemic has also led to increased cyber security concerns. Cybercriminals and other individuals with malicious intent now take COVID-19 as an opportunity to perpetrate cybercrimes, especially for monetary gains. Domestic violence seems to be on the rise perhaps due to the lockdown, contact tracing approaches are massively been developed and used, healthcare systems are being attacked with ransom ware and resources such as patient records confidentiality, and integrity are being compromised.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use published sources to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on auditing, and potential reforms. Findings: COVID-19 was at first expected to have a substantial impact on audit outcomes such as audit opinions. The effects that eventuated have been much less substantial so far. Nevertheless, the authors expect reforms to auditing to take place, especially including non-audit services, reports on inspections of auditors and more reporting on going concern issues by directors, followed by increased responsibility for auditors. In future, there may be further changes including reform to the liability of auditors, reporting on internal control, more responsibility for fraud and changes to corporate governance. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 crisis. Further effects may yet eventuate. Practical implications: Financial report users and auditors should anticipate changes. Originality/value: This paper provides early evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on New Zealand auditing and predicts changes to the regulation of auditing.",Auditing | COVID-19 | Fraud | Going concern | Liability | New Zealand,,"Alexeyeva, I. and Svanström, T.

Contrary to what should have happened to further combat the effect of pandemic, the majority of philanthropic organisations had a negative impact on fundraising, suffering a substantial decrease. Today, the Blockchain can play a pivotal role to re-establish pre-pandemic standards and enhance the development of global philanthropy. However, it is still too little considered due to the criticalities encountered during the launch and development of the initiatives as well as for a general incomprehension of its technology. Therefore, this work aims to demonstrate the Blockchain impact on the development of charity 4.0, especially in an extremely dramatic historical moment marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective is achieved through the case study of Charity Wall, an emerging Italian social marketplace appreciated by important business associations for its innovative solutions in the charity 4.0 sector and for the important support provided to NPOs during their traditional function as well as against Covid-19 in Italy. Through a benchmark analysis, this work succeeds in highlighting the innovative solutions proposed by Charity Wall compared to the charity 4.0 systems on the market. More specifically, through the Charity Wall case study it is possible to demonstrate which aspects of Blockchain technology can be used to strengthen the philanthropic system by avoiding cases of fraud to the detriment of beneficiaries, receivers and donors as well as to create a closer network between the various philanthropic players to support charitable initiatives against the Covid-19.",Blockchain | Development strategies | Digital transactions | Fundraising | Innovation,,"AFP (2020).

Data has been collected using archival research and conversations with some chief risk officers (CROs), internal auditors and insurance practitioners. The authors explain how, following the COVID-19 pandemic, the GCC medical and travel insurance industry faces pricing and fraud risks that need specific planning and control. In the GCC, pricing risk is found to represent an immediate risk that is not easy to manage as historical data is not available. This causes the failure of the present risk models in anticipating the probability and severity of the claims. As a response, insurers rely on scenario analysis and brainstorming to anticipate the costs. Fraud risk is harder to manage, as traditional internal controls are inefficient. Further, both risk managers and internal auditors are currently struggling because of the ‘working from home’ situation and the massive digital transformation in all the transactions. Moreover, the time spent in fraud investigation will delay the payment for hospitalised insurance claims, which would raise concerns about the insurer’s reputation. To resolve this conundrum and manage reputational risk, most GCC insurers seek trade-offs and negotiations with the insured. The authors’ observations and analyses revealed that current responses by GCC insurers are insufficient and need enhancements. Therefore, the authors propose some potential policy solutions that would help insurers overcome both pricing and fraud risks. Through explaining medical and travel insurance risks and proposing potential solutions in this emerging market, this paper provides some practical insights for insurance researchers, insurers and CROs who are seeking solutions to pandemic-related risks.",COVID-19 | Fraud risk | Governmental controls | Medical insurance | Pricing risk | Travel insurance,,"Bryce, C., Ring, P., Ashby, S. and Wardman, J.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all citizens are required to stay at home and most of their times have been used on the internet for their leisure, study and work purposes. The massive use of internet lead to cybercriminal like scam, fraud, hacking and cyber bullying. It has been reported that the senior adult is the most affected group. Using the Information Security Awareness Model (ISACM) and the Situation Awareness Cybersecurity Education Model (SAOCE), this study aims to develop a cybersecurity awareness model that can assist the elderly from attacks in cyberspace. Methodologically, this paper is quantitative in nature and recruits 300 senior adults from age 50 until above 60 years via convenience sampling technique. We identified three factors namely organization, social and individual influencing cybersecurity awareness. The result revealed that organization factors significantly related to cybersecurity awareness with value of β=0.151, p=0.025, meanwhile for social and individual factors are found less significant to cybersecurity awareness with values β=-0.066, p=0.328 and β=0.045, p=0.463 respectively. With the development of cybersecurity awareness model, we are confident that our model can contribute to the body of knowledge within the cybersecurity context.",Covid-19 | Cybersecurity awareness | Elderly | Structural equation modelling,,"https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2017/01/the-elderly-most-at-risk-from-cyber-crime-report-warns/.

Researchers whose work raises doubts about the safety of certain vaccines claim to be victims of discriminatory treatment aimed at suppressing dissent, including the unjustified retraction of their published research. Such practices have previously been discussed in other controversial fields in science (e.g., AIDS, the environment, and water fluoridation) but not in the field of vaccines. The purpose of this study was to analyze, for the first time, the subjective views of researchers whose papers were retracted. Study participants are active researchers, most with international reputations in their respective fields. They perceived retraction as a means of censoring and silencing critical voices with the aim of preserving the pro-vaccination agenda of interested parties. Participants also reported additional measures aimed at harming them personally and professionally. These findings point to the need for a fair, open, and honest discourse about the safety of vaccines for the benefit of public health and the restoration of trust in science and medicine.",medical research | public health | retraction | suppression of dissent | Vaccines,,"The Academy of Medical Sciences (2017).

Aviantara R.,57221604168,Scoring the financial distress and the financial statement fraud of Garuda Indonesia with «DDCC» as the financial solutions,2021,Journal of Modelling in Management,,,,,,,0,10.1108/JM2-01-2020-0017,,"Purpose: PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) Persero Tbk is the one only pride airline of Indonesian sovereignty. Although the bird achieved abundant international awards and certifications, the bird is dying and needs a remedy immediately. The frequent annual turnover of board executives did not make impact to the financial performance; this seems to be tip of the iceberg, peculiar with the number of restatement over the past decade. Therefore, this paper aims to address the issue through the function of five red flags model which known as Altman Z-score, Sprigate S-score, Grover G-score, Beneish M-score and Dechow F-score. Design/methodology/approach: This is exploratory study of univariate analysis using financial distress and fraudulent financial statement approach, while the type of data is secondary taken from Indonesia Stock Exchange during 12 years observation from 2007 to 2018. Findings: Altman, Springate and Grover produce strong indication of GIAA’s financial distress; all models score the same distress indication by 14 times. All distress models agreed that only 2011 and 2012 classify to the safe zone when GIAA performed the corporate actions. Beneish scores fraud indication by eight times. Dechow scores slightly higher by nine times. The number of fraud predictions in this research are in line with the number of restatement, which proves the assumption that restatement can be used as a signal of the financial statement fraud. When GIAA categorized in safe zone, both Beneish and Dechow score no to fraud, this indicates the fraud occurence during health period is lower. Research limitations/implications: The motivation behind the financial statement fraud is not discuss through this research but from the primary theory of the fraud triangle. Financial distress possesses strong relationship with pressure factor; therefore, exit from financial crisis is one of the best solution to mitigate the financial statement fraud. Practical implications: The average of Beneish score is −2,26, slightly above the manipulator threshold which is −2,22. This must be marked as an ample conjecture of GIAA’s fraud inclination and been a highlight for the auditor both internal and external when performing control testing, attestation and other assurance services. Social implications: All models in this study can apply to any other corporate issues, especially for evaluating the government company who has loosen the public trust recently in Indonesia such as PT Asuransi Jiwasraya and PT Asabri. Moreover, the pandemic COVID-19 has brought the world to the new unprecedented risk, especially the economic turmoil which lead the possibilities of corporate distress and fraud. By applying these scores, public might have tools as pre-elemenary assessment to serve a decision where to put trust in a company.

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper draws on empirical evidence from a range of sources (including official statistics) and the existing research literature, and revisits routine activities theory to illuminate the way that cybercrime patterns are being transformed by the pandemic. Findings: The pandemic is reshaping the routine activities of societies en masse, leading to changes in the ecology of risk and opportunity for cybercrime. There is evidence of a large increase in the prevalence of cybercrime as a result, yet much of this has a paradoxically “local” character. Practical implications: The authors identify specific practical implications for law enforcement, namely, that the role of local police in policing cybercrime should be re-envisioned, with a democratic, community-oriented approach at its heart. Originality/value: The theoretical perspective outlined is a novel and critical development of a well-established framework, opening up new paths to the theorisation of cybercrime and cybercrime policing.

Qualitatively, this paper examines these crimes, their peculiarities, and how they can be curtailed. Although the United States of America (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) have put in place cyber hygiene and preventive enforcement measures to curtail the activities of cybercriminals in cyberspace, the same cannot be said of Nigeria. Arguably, cybercrime institutions in Nigeria lack adequate capacity building, professional competence, and inter-agency cooperation concerning cyber coronavirus crimes.

Depends on the place: Corruption and social distancing in American states,2021,Social Science and Medicine,269,,113569,,,,0,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113569,,We investigate the links between corruption and compliance with social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic in America. Both theory and empirical evidence point to a corrosive effect of corruption on trust/social capital which in turn determine people's behavior towards compliance with public health policies. Using data from 50 states we find that people who live in more corrupt states are less likely to comply with so called shelter in place/stay at home orders.

Within a few weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak, lockdown accelerated the adoption of digital solutions at an unprecedented pace, creating unforeseen opportunities for scaling up alternative approaches to social and economic life. But it also brought digital risks and threats that placed new demands on policymakers. This article assembles evidence from different areas of social science expertise about the impacts of Covid-19 in digitised societies and policy responses. The authors show how the pandemic supported changes in data collection techniques and dissemination practices for official statistics, and how seemingly insuperable obstacles to the implementation of e-health treatments were largely overcome. They demonstrate how the ethics of artificial intelligence became a primary concern for government legislation at national and international levels, and how the features enabling smart cities to act as drivers of productivity did not necessarily give them an advantage during the pandemic. At the micro-level, families are shown to have become ‘digital by default’, as children were exposed to online risks and opportunities. Globally, the spread of the pandemic provided a fertile ground for cybercrime, while digital disinformation and influencing risked becoming normalised and domesticated.",children online | Covid-19 | e-mental health | ethics of AI | official statistics | smart cities | social media policing,,"Allin, P., (2021).

Bramstedt K.A.,57206163716,Unicorn Poo and Blessed Waters: COVID-19 Quackery and FDA Warning Letters,2021,Therapeutic Innovation and Regulatory Science,55,1,,239,244,,0,10.1007/s43441-020-00224-1,,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global setting of clinical crisis and human anxiety. Without available safe and effective vaccines and cures, an unscrupulous marketplace has emerged selling COVID-19 quackery (fraudulent misrepresentation of preventions and treatments). Methods: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Warning Letters issued from March 2020 to July 2020 were analyzed for themes pertaining to unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded COVID-19 products. Results: During this period, the FDA issued 3,139 Warning Letters of which 98 (3.14%) of these were focused on COVID-19-related drugs, devices, biologics, and dietary supplements (products and ingredients). Specifically, these Warning Letters revealed regulatory nonconformities involving 40 identified herbs, 22 minerals/compounds, 6 devices and biologicals, and 3 vitamins. Products included hand sanitizers; COVID-19 antibody test kits; herbal teas and tinctures; nasal gel; toothpaste; and 1 vaccine. Nine Warning Letters were issued for products being sold via the Amazon online shopping platform. Conclusion: A small percentage of FDA Warning Letters recently have been focused on COVID-19. These Letters expose the blatant and potentially harmful quackery of vendors across the world who prioritize financial gain over clinical beneficence. Patient history-taking should include queries about non-traditional and unapproved products to identify, document, and report potentially harmful quackery. FDA Warning Letters are a component of meaningful corrective action; however, greater effort in spreading awareness of such misrepresented, unapproved, and adulterated products is needed to deter purchases of such products.",Bioethics | COVID-19 | Quackery | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 | Standards,"Correspondence as Topic | COVID-19 | Databases, Factual | Fraud | Government Regulation | Humans | Quackery | SARS-CoV-2 | United States | United States Food and Drug Administration","World Health Organization.

It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies.",corruption risk assessment | COVID-19 | data mining | data science | decision support system | fraud detection | public procurement | risk patterns,Conflicts of interest | Data mining algorithm | Decision support system (dss) | Fraud detection | Law-enforcement agencies | Money laundering | Public procurement | Systematic analysis,"Broms, R., Dahlström, C., Fazekas, M., 2019.

This paper presents preliminary analyses about the short-term effect of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on cyber-dependent crime and online fraud in the UK. Time series analyses from data about crimes known to police between May 2019 and May 2020 are used to explore the extent to which cybercrime has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. More specifically, we examine whether cybercrime has suffered an increase during the months with the strictest lockdown restrictions, as an effect of the displacement of crime opportunities from physical to online environments. Results indicate that reports of cybercrime have increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, and these were remarkably large during the two months with the strictest lockdown policies and measures. In particular, the number of frauds associated with online shopping and auctions, and the hacking of social media and email, which are the two most common cybercrime categories in the UK, have seen the largest increases in the number of incidents. The increase in cyber-dependent crimes has mainly been experienced by individual victims rather than organisations.",Crime trends | cyber security | fraud | Internet | police statistics | routine activities,,"Ashby, M., (2020a) ‘ Initial evidence on the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the United States ’, Crime Science 9 (6). doi: 10.1186/s40163-020-00117-6. ; Ashby, M., (2020b) ‘Why you can't identify changes in crime by comparing this month to last month’, Social Research Association, 13 May. ; Caneppele, S., and Aebi, M., (2017) ‘ Crime drop or police recording flop?

Moreover, these approaches may also be used in evaluating the performance of public health surveillance systems. We provide theoretical arguments for why the empirical laws should hold in the early stages of an epidemic, along with preliminary empirical evidence in support of these claims. Based on data published by the World Health Organization and various national governments, we find empirical evidence that suggests that both Benford’s law and Zipf’s law largely hold across countries, and deviations can be readily explained. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to present a practical application of Zipf’s law to fraud detection.",,"COVID-19 | Humans | Models, Theoretical | Pandemics | Reproducibility of Results | SARS-CoV-2","Bolton RJ, Hand DJ.

"Djordjevic S. , Dobovsek B.","57219204420 , 23004313200",Organised crime in Western Balkans Six at the onset of coronavirus,2020,International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy,40,9-10,,807,820,,1,10.1108/IJSSP-06-2020-0229,,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into crime-fighting and present new criminal landscapes in the Western Balkans Six (WB6) (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) at the beginning of the pandemic crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on the content analysis of legal acts, strategic documents, academic articles, media reporting, official documents, four semi-structured interviews with civil society organisations, two consultations with police officers and two consultations with civil society organisations. Findings: In the first nine weeks of the spread of COVID-19, the WB6 experienced a small rise in the price of marijuana. The same applied to stimulant drugs like ecstasy and amphetamines. However, very little heroin was available. Prices of protective face masks, disinfectants and medicinal alcohol skyrocketed due to attempts at price gouging. There were cases of scams using mobile and digital technologies, as well as burglaries of newspaper or cigarette kiosks, shops, pharmacies and exchange offices. It was difficult to determine whether the smuggling of and trafficking in human beings experienced a decline or increase. No cases of sexual exploitation for providing online services were noted, although the number of calls made to organisations that assist in the area of human trafficking increased. People with drug and alcohol problems, persons living with HIV, those susceptible to stress, citizens with mental health problems, pensioners, the poor, the homeless and recently released prisoners were the biggest potential victims of crime at the onset of the crisis brought by the pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are limited to specific forms of crime (illicit drug trade, economic crime, fraud, scams, theft, smuggling of and trafficking in human beings) in the WB6 and based on findings from four interviews and four consultations, together with available secondary data. Originality/value: This is the first overview of criminal activities occurring in the WB6 during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.",Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Organised crime | Western Balkans,,"Albanian Daily News (2020), “Coronavirus affects everything but crime”, available at: https://www.albaniandailynews.com/index.php?idm=40298&mod=2 (accessed 12 March 2020). ; Anastasijević, D.

In this paper, PaySim Mobile Money Simulator data is used with a machine learning algorithm called probabilistic neural network (PNN) to classify whether the customer's actions are normal or fraudulent actions. This PNN approach combined using binary classification to prevent fraudulent actions in transactions that have been or are being used by customers. And the result indicated that this system able to classify class 0 (as a normal class customer) and 1 (as a fraudulent class customer). Based on this result, maybe it would help many sectors that involved as a tool to classify a genuine customer.

The current research is an attempt to develop and validate a tool to document falsified hand sanitizer in the UAE community. Method: A descriptive cross-sectional community-based study was conducted among 1280 randomly selected participants. Respondents were sent a web-based electronic link to the survey via email. Content validity, factor analyses and known group validity were used to develop and validate a new scale to identify falsified hand sanitizer. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, item internal consistency (IIC), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the reliability of the scale. SPSS version 24 was used to conduct data analysis. Results: A total of 1280 participants were enrolled in the study. The content validity index (CVI) was 0.83 with the final scale of 12 items. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value was 0.788, with the Bartlett test of sphericity achieving statistical significance (p < 0.001). Our factor analysis revealed a 3-component model. The 3-factor solution was confirmed by PCFA analysis and had associations with good fit values. The PCFA for NFI was 0.970, CFI 0.978, and TLI 0.967. All values were in excess of 0.95, with RMSEA values below 0.06 at 0.03; all of these values indicated a good model fit. The Cronbach’s alpha was good overall (0.867). All factors had a Cronbach’s alpha value in excess of 0.70. The instrument demonstrated that every item met the IIC correlation standard ≥0.40. The scale displayed good overall ICC statistics of 0.867 (95% CI 0.856–0.877) with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The scale’s test-retest reliability was assessed through correlation of the falsified hand sanitizer identification score of respondents at the two time points. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.770 (p value < 0.01). Participants with post-graduate education were more likely to identify the falsified hand sanitizer compared to those with high school education. (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study developed and validated a new scale for the measurement of falsified hand sanitizer. This is expected to improve and promote collaboration between the health regulators and the public and hereby encourage customer satisfaction and participation.",Counterfeit | COVID-19 | Falsified hand sanitizer | Regulation and compliance behaviours | Reliability analysis | Validation studies,"Adolescent | Adult | Coronavirus Infections | Cross-Sectional Studies | Factor Analysis, Statistical | Female | Fraud | Hand Sanitizers | Humans | Male | Middle Aged | Pandemics | Pilot Projects | Pneumonia, Viral | Public Health | Reproducibility of Results | Surveys and Questionnaires | United Arab Emirates | Young Adult","Pires D, de Kraker MEA, Tartari E, Abbas M, Pittet D. ‘Fight antibiotic resistance—It’s in your hands’: call from the World Health Organization for 5th may 2017.

An analysis of UK law enforcement tweeting practices during the Covid-19 pandemic",2020,Crime Science,9,1,20,,,,1,10.1186/s40163-020-00129-2,,"Crisis and disruption are often unpredictable and can create opportunities for crime. During such times, policing may also need to meet additional challenges to handle the disruption. The use of social media by officials can be essential for crisis mitigation and crime reduction. In this paper, we study the use of Twitter for crime mitigation and reduction by UK police (and associated) agencies in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that whilst most of the tweets from our sample concerned issues that were not specifically about crime, especially during the first stages of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in tweets about fraud, cybercrime and domestic abuse. There was also an increase in retweeting activity as opposed to the creation of original messages. Moreover, in terms of the impact of tweets, as measured by the rate at which they are retweeted, followers were more likely to ‘spread the word’ when the tweet was content-rich (discussed a crime specific matter and contained media), and account holders were themselves more active on Twitter. Considering the changing world we live in, criminal opportunity is likely to evolve. To help mitigate this, policy makers and researchers should consider more systematic approaches to developing social media communication strategies for the purpose of crime mitigation and reduction during disruption and change more generally. We suggest a framework for so doing.",Covid-19 | Crime prevention | Crime reduction | Crisis communication | Disruption | Evidence-based policing | Police | Social media policy | Twitter,,"Ahmed, W., Bath, P.

As such, international organizations such as the World Health Organizations and the United Nations Development Program are creating an evidence base on how best to address corruption in health systems. At present, the risk of corruption is even more apparent, given the need for quick and nimble responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may include a relaxation of standards and the rapid mobilization of large funds. As international organizations and governments attempt to respond to the ever-changing demands of this pandemic, there is a need to acknowledge and address the increased opportunity for corruption. In order to explore how such risks of corruption are addressed in international organizations, this paper focuses on the question: How are international organizations implementing measures to promote accountability and transparency, and anti-corruption, in their own operations? The following international organizations were selected as the focus of this paper given their current involvement in anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability in the health sector: the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank Group, and the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Our findings demonstrate that there has been a clear increase in the volume and scope of anti-corruption, accountability, and transparency measures implemented by these international organizations in recent years.

This article uses unique access to a volunteer group’s database focused on preventing pet scams to explore this type of crime. Distances, among other factors, make the purchase of pets online common in countries such as the USA, Australia and South Africa. This modality of purchase has been exploited by organized criminals largely based in Cameroon to conduct advance fee and non-delivery frauds. The article uses data from the volunteer group Petscams.com to provide unique insights on the techniques of the offenders with particular reference to the strategies used to maximize victimization by using real accounts of victims of such frauds. It also briefly notes how the COVID-19 crisis has been used to adapt this type of scam. The article’s discussion identifies the need for a more nuanced assessment into the role of victim oriented voluntary organizations.",Cybercrime | fraud | pet scams | scams | techniques,,"Abia W.

People and organizations all over the world have had to adjust to new ways of work and life. We explore possible scenarios of the digital surge and the research issues that arise. An increase in digitalization is leading firms and educational institutions to shift to work-from-home (WFH). Blockchain technology will become important and will entail research on design and regulations. Gig workers and the gig economy is likely to increase in scale, raising questions of work allocation, collaboration, motivation, and aspects of work overload and presenteeism. Workplace monitoring and technostress issues will become prominent with an increase in digital presence. Online fraud is likely to grow, along with research on managing security. The regulation of the internet, a key resource, will be crucial post-pandemic. Research may address the consequences and causes of the digital divide. Further, the issues of net neutrality and zero-rating plans will merit scrutiny. A key research issue will also be the impact and consequences of internet shutdowns, frequently resorted to by countries. Digital money, too, assumes importance in crisis situations and research will address their adoption, consequences, and mode.

Mucchielli L.,18038384000,Behind the French controversy over the medical treatment of Covid-19: The role of the drug industry,2020,Journal of Sociology,56,4,,736,744,,1,10.1177/1440783320936740,,"This article explores the stakes of the very intense controversy that has developed in France around the medical treatment of Covid-19 (which finds some parallels in the United States of America). It centres on the therapeutic proposal of a Marseilles doctor, who has become a very divisive ‘star’ in public debates over the efficacy of treatment. The author shows that competition between this doctor’s proposal and the commercial hopes of a major pharmaceutical company plays an important role. This company has managed to create links of interest with many other major doctors, some of whom are at the heart of the decision-making process concerning the management of the health crisis. Finally, the author places this episode within the broader question of the hold the drug industry has on scientific production within the medical field. The interdependence between health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry is anything but healthy. The Covid-19 debate conforms to a well-worn pattern of behaviour: public backlash over the transgressions of wealthy corporate actors, government regulatory responses insisting on greater levels of transparency, corporate circumvention of said regulations, resulting in the continuation of fraud and corruption.",Covid-19 | drug industry | French public debate | influence peddling | scientific production; therapeutics,,"Abecassis P., Coutinet N., (2018) Économie du medicament.

Wang L.,57224690311,Judging pre-owned-bicycle deals type using machine learning methods,2020,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,3449321,114,120,,0,10.1145/3449301.3449321,,"Under the influence brought by Covid-19, people who used to take bus for commuting and traveling are tending to cycle to the places they would like to go. So many of them choose to buy a pre-owned bike because of the cheap price. However, many of them complaint that they didn't get the lowest price they could get. The focus of this study is using logistic regression to build a classifier to determine if a pre-owned road bicycle deal is a good deal or not. Unlike new products with a fixed price, asymmetric information between the sellers and buyers before the transaction, lack of reliable transactional schemes due to frequent frauds and chaos during the transactions, and missing after-sales guarantee mechanism in pre-owned things deals. The result of the study could help people intending to buy a pre-owned road bicycle before they make the deal by letting them enter the key information of the bicycle they are about to buy and predict if the deal is a good deal or not, where ""0""represent the bad deal while ""1""represents the opposite.",Bicycle | Logistic regression | Machine learning,After-sales | Asymmetric information | Fixed prices | Lowest price | Machine learning methods,"Lynn, and Yu.

However, the volume of remote work is unprecedented and creates opportunities for cyber attackers to penetrate home computers. Attackers have been leveraging websites with COVID-19 related names, dubbed COVID-19 themed malicious websites. These websites mostly contain false information, fake forms, fraudulent payments, scams, or malicious payloads to steal sensitive information or infect victims' computers. In this paper, we present a data-driven study on characterizing and detecting COVID-19 themed malicious websites. Our characterization study shows that attackers are agile and are deceptively crafty in designing geolocation targeted websites, often leveraging popular domain registrars and top-level domains. Our detection study shows that the Random Forest classifier can detect COVID-19 themed malicious websites based on the lexical and WHOIS features defined in this paper, achieving a 98% accuracy and 2.7% false-positive rate.",COVID-19 Cyberattacks | Defense | Detection | Malicious Websites,Characterization studies | Cyber attackers | False positive rates | Geolocations | Global community | Random forest classifier | Sensitive informations | Top level domains,"J.

It investigates if shared approaches of the problem and solutions could emerge. Some relevant aspects of the medical system as it reacted to the pandemic crisis and the situation in forensic science are presented. Further, three main stages of the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on individuals and society are proposed, highlighting similarities to the effects of forensic science. Finally, some lessons from COVID-19 for forensic science are identified and discussed.

In the early days of the pandemic, US president Donald J Trump has endorsed the use of unproven therapies. Subsequently, a death attributed to the wrongful ingestion of a chloroquine-containing compound occurred. Objective: We investigated Donald J Trump's speeches and Twitter posts, as well as Google searches and Amazon purchases, and television airtime for mentions of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir. Methods: Twitter sourcing was catalogued with Factba.se, and analytics data, both past and present, were analyzed with Tweet Binder to assess average analytics data on key metrics. Donald J Trump's time spent discussing unverified treatments on the United States' 5 largest TV stations was catalogued with the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, and his speech transcripts were obtained from White House briefings. Google searches and shopping trends were analyzed with Google Trends. Amazon purchases were assessed using Helium 10 software. Results: From March 1 to April 30, 2020, Donald J Trump made 11 tweets about unproven therapies and mentioned these therapies 65 times in White House briefings, especially touting hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These tweets had an impression reach of 300% above Donald J Trump's average. Following these tweets, at least 2% of airtime on conservative networks for treatment modalities like azithromycin and continuous mentions of such treatments were observed on stations like Fox News. Google searches and purchases increased following his first press conference on March 19, 2020, and increased again following his tweets on March 21, 2020. The same is true for medications on Amazon, with purchases for medicine substitutes, such as hydroxychloroquine, increasing by 200%. Conclusions: Individuals in positions of power can sway public purchasing, resulting in undesired effects when the individuals' claims are unverified. Public health officials must work to dissuade the use of unproven treatments for COVID-19.",Analysis | Behavior | Behavioral economics | COVID-19 | Economics | Influence | Infodemic | Infodemiology | Infoveillance | Media | Public health | Trend | Twitter,"Adenosine Monophosphate | Alanine | Azithromycin | Chloroquine | Communication | Coronavirus Infections | Federal Government | Fraud | Humans | Hydroxychloroquine | Internet | Language | Mass Media | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral | Public Health | United States","Wang Y, Zhang D, Du G, Du R, Zhao J, Jin Y, et al.

These underground markets exist in tension between two opposing forces: the drive to hide incriminating information, and the trust and stability benefits that greater openness yields. Revealing information about transactions to mitigate scams also provides valuable data about the market. We analyse the first dataset, of which we are aware, about the transactions created and completed on a well-known and high-traffic underground marketplace, Hack Forums, along with the associated threads and posts made by its users over two recent years, from June 2018 to June 2020. We use statistical modelling approaches to analyse the economic and social characteristics of the market over three eras, especially its performance as an infrastructure for trust. In the Set-up era, we observe the growth of users making only one transaction, as well as 'power-users' who make many transactions. In the Stable era, we observe a wide range of activities (including large-scale transfers of intermediate currencies such as Amazon Giftcards) which declines slowly from an initial peak. Finally, we analyse the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, concluding that while we see a significant increase in transactins across all categories, this reflects a stimulus of the market, rather than a transformation. New users overcome the 'cold start' problem by engaging in low-level currency exchanges to prove their trustworthiness. We observe currency exchange accounts for most contracts, and Bitcoin and PayPal are the preferred payment methods by trading values and number of contracts involved. The market is becoming more centralised over time around influential users and threads, with significant changes observed during the Set-up and Covid-19 eras.",coronavirus | Covid-19 | cybercrime market | economic evolution | hacking forums | pandemic | underground economy,Centralised | Currency exchange | Influential users | Payment methods | Power users | Scale transfer | Statistical modelling | Trust and reputation,"Sadia Afroz, Vaibhav Garg, Damon McCoy, and Rachel Greenstadt. 2013.

In doing their field works at the moment, a lot of auditors rely on technology to ensure the good quality of their audit by making certain that the audit report is free from fraud, which has to be supported by a competent auditor. This research aims to see the effect of information technology audit in detecting fraud using the competence of the auditor as a moderation variable. The data are collected from sample auditors working for Public Accounting Firms in Bandung and Jakarta, which are then processed using regression analysis equipment. The findings show that the information audit influences the quality of the audit in detecting fraud using the competence of the auditor as a moderation variable in which the results are used to advise the Public Accounting Firms to be mindful of the competence of the auditor, specifically in the field of IT auditing in order to have a good quality audit report.",Audit Quality | Competence | Fraud | Information Technology Audit,Audit reports | Field works | Information audit | Jakarta | Public accounting | Quality audits,"R.

DRL, through a wide range of capabilities from reinforcement learning (RL) to deep learning (DL), offers vast opportunities for handling sophisticated dynamic economics systems. DRL is characterized by scalability with the potential to be applied to high-dimensional problems in conjunction with noisy and nonlinear patterns of economic data. In this paper, we initially consider a brief review of DL, RL, and deep RL methods in diverse applications in economics, providing an in-depth insight into the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the architecture of DRL applied to economic applications is investigated in order to highlight the complexity, robustness, accuracy, performance, computational tasks, risk constraints, and profitability. The survey results indicate that DRL can provide better performance and higher efficiency as compared to the traditional algorithms while facing real economic problems in the presence of risk parameters and the ever-increasing uncertainties.",5G | Anomaly detection | Applied informatics | Big data | COVID-19 | Data science | Deep learning | Deep reinforcement learning | Economics | Ensemble | Explainable artificial intelligence | Fraud detection | Literature review | Machine learning | Mathematics | Prisma | Supervised learning | Survey,,"Erhan, D.

We witness increasing morbidity, delivery systems that sometimes are on the brink of collapse, and some shameless rent seeking. However, besides all the challenges, there are also possibilities that are opening up. In this perspective, we focus on lessons from COVID-19 to increase the sustainability of health systems. If we catch the opportunities, the crisis might very well be a policy window for positive reforms. We describe the positive opportunities that the COVID-19 crisis has opened to reduce the sources of waste for our health systems: failures of care delivery, failures of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, administrative complexity, pricing failures and fraud and abuse. We argue that current events can canalize some very needy reforms to make our systems more sustainable. As always, political policy windows are temporarily open, and so swift action is needed, otherwise the opportunity will pass and the vested interests will come back to pursue their own agendas.

Universitas Bhayangkara Jakarta Raya, as a case study, uses attendance record as the factor for final grade calculation. Many attendance recording systems were developed using biometrics, e.g. face recognition, iris recognition, and fingerprint recognition. In this study, face recognition was proposed since the face cannot be duplicated and can eliminate fraud committed by students. In addition, this contactless method could minimize the risk of COVID-19 spread with some additional treatments. The local binary pattern (LBP) was proposed in this study. This method has the ability to describe the texture and shape of an image by dividing the image into small portions of feature extraction.

Freckelton QC I.,57216440586,"COVID-19: Fear, quackery, false representations and the law",2020,International Journal of Law and Psychiatry,72,,101611,,,,13,10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101611,,"Fear, anxiety and even paranoia can proliferate during a pandemic. Such conditions, even when subclinical, tend to be a product of personal and predispositional factors, as well as shared cultural influences, including religious, literary, film, and gaming, all of which can lead to emotional and less than rational responses. They can render people vulnerable to engage in implausible conspiracy theories about the causes of illness and governmental responses to it. They can also lead people to give credence to simplistic and unscientific misrepresentations about medications and devices which are claimed to prevent, treat or cure disease. In turn such vulnerability creates predatory opportunities for the unscrupulous. This article notes the eruption of quackery during the 1889–1892 Russian Flu and the 1918–1920 Spanish Flu and the emergence during 2020 of spurious claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. It identifies consumer protection strategies and interventions formulated during the 2020 pandemic. Using examples from the United States, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom, it argues that during a pandemic there is a need for three responses by government to the risks posed by conspiracy theories and false representations: calm, scientifically-based messaging from public health authorities; cease and desist warnings directed toward those making extravagant or inappropriate claims; and the taking of assertive and well publicised legal action against individuals and entities that make false representations in order to protect consumers rendered vulnerable by their emotional responses to the phenomenology of the pandemic.",Apocalyptic computer games | Cease and desist orders | Conspiracy theories | Consumer protection | COVID-19 | Dread | Fear | Pandemic films | Pandemic literature | Pandemics | Prosecution | Public health responses | Quackery | Vulnerabilities - false representations,"Australia | Betacoronavirus | Coronavirus Infections | Fraud | Health Behavior | Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice | Humans | Japan | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral | Public Health | Public Health Practice | Quackery | Social Media | Truth Disclosure | United States","Anderson, I., Hern, A., Pierce, J., et al.

This paper brings together key scientific uncertainties regarding the use of serological tests to assure immune status and a public health ethics perspective to inform key considerations in the ethical implementation of immunity passport policies. Ill-conceived policies have the potential to cause severe unintended harms that could result in greater inequity, the stigmatization of certain sectors of society, and heightened risks and unequal treatment of individuals due to erroneous test results. Immunity passports could, however, be used to achieve collective benefits and benefits for specific populations besides facilitating economic recovery. We conclude that sector-based policies that prioritize access to testing based on societal need are likely to be fairer and logistically more feasible, while minimizing stigma and reducing incentives for fraud. Clear guidelines need to be set out for which sectors of society should be prioritized for testing, and rigorous mechanisms should be in place to validate test results and identify cases of reinfection.",Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Disease control policy | Equity | Ethics | Immunity passports | SARS-CoV-2 | Serological assays | Stigma,"Betacoronavirus | Certification | Clinical Laboratory Techniques | Coronavirus Infections | Health Policy | Humans | Immunity | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral | Public Health | Serologic Tests","World Health Organization. “Immunity passports” in the context of COVID-19. https://www.who.int/publications-detail/immunitypassports-in-the-context-of-covid-19.

Telemedicine provides increased access to medical care and helps to mitigate risk by conserving personal protective equipment and providing for social/physical distancing to continue to treat patients with a variety of allergic and immunologic conditions. During this time, many allergy and immunology clinicians have needed to adopt telemedicine expeditiously in their practices while studying the complex and variable issues surrounding its regulation and reimbursement. Some concerns have been temporarily alleviated since March 2020 to aid with patient care in the setting of COVID-19. Other changes are ongoing at the time of this publication. Members of the Telemedicine Work Group in the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) completed a telemedicine literature review of online and Pub Med resources through May 9, 2020, to detail Pre-COVID-19 telemedicine knowledge and outline up-to-date telemedicine material. This work group report was developed to provide guidance to allergy/immunology clinicians as they navigate the swiftly evolving telemedicine landscape.",Billing | Coding | Telehealth | Telemedicine,"Allergy and Immunology | Betacoronavirus | Clinical Coding | Computer Security | Coronavirus Infections | Health Services Accessibility | Humans | Hypersensitivity | Infection Control | Insurance, Health, Reimbursement | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral | Societies, Medical | Telemedicine","Shaker, M.S., Oppenheimer, J., Grayson, M., Stukus, D., Hartog, N., Hsieh, E.W.Y., et al.

The Internet has become an effective channel for social interactions nowadays. Peoples' immense dependence on digital platform opens doors for fraud. Phishing is a type of cybercrime to steal users' credentials from online platforms such as online banking, online business, e-commerce, online classroom, digital marketplaces, etc. Phishers develop fake webpages alike the original one and send spam emails to hook the users. Phishers seize users' credentials when an online user visits the counterfeit webpages through the spams. Researchers have introduced enormous tools like blacklist, white-list, and antivirus software to detect phishing webpages. Attackers always devise creative ways to exploit human and network weakness to penetrate cyber defense. This paper presents a data-driven framework for detecting phishing webpages using deep learning approach. More precisely, a multilayer perceptron, which is also referred as a feed-forward neural network is used to predict the phishing webpages. The dataset was collected from Kaggle and contains information of ten thousand webpages. It consists of ten attributes. The proposed model has achieved 95% training accuracy and 93% test accuracy.",Artificial intelligence | Convolutional neural network | Deep learning | Machine learning | Phishing attack | Phishing attack detection,Antivirus softwares | Digital marketplace | Digital platforms | Learning approach | Online classroom | Phishing attacks | Social interactions | Training accuracy,"R.

Based on insights from routine activity theory (Cohen & Felson 1979), it is likely that COVID-19 will influence victimization rates as people alter their routines and spend more time at home and less time in public. Yet, the pandemic may affect victimization differently depending on the type of crime as street crimes appear to be decreasing while domestic crimes may be increasing. We consider a third type of crime: cybercrime. Treating the pandemic as a natural experiment, we investigate how the pandemic has affected rates of cybervictimization. We compare pre-pandemic rates of victimization with post-pandemic rates of victimization using datasets designed to track cybercrime. After considering how the pandemic may alter routines and affect cybervictimization, we find that the pandemic has not radically altered cyberroutines nor changed cybervictimization rates. However, a model using routine activity theory to predict cybervictimization offers clear support for the theory’s efficacy both before and after the pandemic. We conclude by considering plausible explanations for our findings.",COVID-19 | Cybercrime | Cybervictimization | Natural experiment | Routine activity theory,,"Bartash, J. (2020).

Delap N.,57189581150,What does COVID-19 mean for new mothers in prison?,2020,British Journal of Midwifery,28,8,,460,461,,0,,,"Most women entering prison to serve a sentence (80%) have committed a non-violent offence (Halliday, 2020). More women are sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and motoring offences combined (Halliday, 2019). And the proportion of women serving very short prison sentences has risen sharply: In 1993, only a third of custodial sentences given to women were for less than six months; in 2018, it was nearly double this (62%) (Halliday, 2019). Coordinated releases and an end to custodial sentencing in all but the most exceptional of cases provide the answers to minimising the risk to mothers and babies in the pandemic situation, as they did before the pandemic, and as they will continue to after this current public health crisis passes. We cannot wait for another tragic headline, another death, before we make these changes. We hope the government will maintain its commitment to the supported release of as many pregnant women and mothers of young children as possible, as set out two months ago, and will use this opportunity to deliver a sustained, significant reduction in the number of women sentenced to prison as set out in the 'Female offender strategy' (Ministry of Justice, 2018) two years ago. It's the only way to bring an end to this country's shocking record of inadequate care and tragic outcomes for pregnant women, new mothers and their children in our prisons.",,,"Barnes, D.

Over the years, developing countries have been piloting the various forms of FinTech, but the very one that has come to stay is the Mobile Money Transactions (MMT). As mobile money transactions attempt to gain a foothold, it faces several problems, the most important of them is mobile money fraud. This paper seeks to provide a solution to this problem by looking at machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (kernel-based), gradient boosted decision tree (tree-based) and Naïve Bayes (probabilistic based) algorithms, taking into consideration the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

The bulk of attention is given to fraud victimization, with consideration also given to parent abuse, partner violence, and patient abuse. A review of data from the Federal Trade Commission shows that reports of most types of fraud grew significantly in the first three months of 2020 in comparison to the same time period in 2019. Differences between fraud experiences based on age are considered. Older persons lost much more to fraud than younger persons, and far more in 2020 than 2019. In addition, they reported being targeted more often for certain types of cybercrime (i.e., tech support scams). While devastating to everyone, it is concluded that the coronavirus will potentially have a more significant impact on the financial health of older persons than younger persons. It is concluded that minimizing the consequences of all forms of crimes targeting older adults will be best achieved by using a public health approach.",Coronavirus | Cybercrime | Elder abuse | Fraud,,"Agnew, R.

And, if carried to conclusion, how would such actions impact the entire economy? Case overview/synopsis: In April 2020 South Africa’s stated-owned electricity utility Eskom sent a pre-cautionary force-majeure notification to Exxaro Limited’s Grootegeluk Coal Mine. The notification, citing COVID-19 as an unforeseeable, external and irresistible event, would have disastrous consequences for the mine’s 25 m tonnes pa coal contract to supply Eskom’s Medupi power station. Not only was the legality of the force-majeure questionable, it was unethical, and not in the spirit of President Ramaposa’s call to businesses to continue paying contractors. The case briefly describes Eskom’s troubled history following South Africa’s 1994 democratic election. It examines the force majeure clause common in contracts, and questions whether COVID-19 meets the criteria of an “unforeseeable, external and irresistible” event.

This year, the conference theme is “Making the Web Human-Centric? New Directions in the Web and AI."" As the workshop chairs, we selected workshops that exemplify this theme to complement the conference contributions. The theme of making the Web more human-centric is especially fitting this year as the workshops are held in the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic backdrop making the Web an ever more human-centric medium for work, play, communication, and many other societal necessities. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and the racial injustice riots that erupted in some parts of the world have forced Web Scientists to examine new directions for the Web and AI. These workshops span topics ranging from inequality, AI on the Web for social good, personalisation and community, explanations for AI, cybercrime and cybersecurity, data immortality, and evolutionary thinking for the Web.",AI on the Web | Bias | Climate Change | Collective Intelligence | Cybercrime | Data Ethics | Digital Humanitarianism | Digital Inequalities | Education | Global South & Globalization | Health and Wellness | Misinformation | Social Connections Internet Politics | Social Good,Cyber security | Cybercrime | Evolutionary thinking | Human-centric | Personalisation | Virtual workshops | Web science,"Matteo Chinazzi, Jessica T Davis, Marco Ajelli, Corrado Gioannini, Maria Litvinova, Stefano Merler, Ana Pastore y Piontti, Kunpeng Mu, Luca Rossi, Kaiyuan Sun, et al. 2020.

The method used in this paper is to analyze data qualitatively in relation to this research which is a normative juridical type.

Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel “infodemic,” including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable “cures.” Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. Objective: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19–related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. Methods: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19–related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. Results: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19–related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. Conclusions: Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the “infodemic” fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public.",Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Cybercrime | Fraud | Infectious disease | Infodemic | Infodemiology | Infoveillance | Social media | Surveillance,,"Patterson KD, Pyle GF.

To prevent spread of the virus, social distancing has become the norm worldwide. However, with social distancing comes significantly less face-to-face interaction, which may be particularly harmful to older adults given their existing levels of loneliness. While social technologies can be used to provide critical social interaction during this time of necessary physical distancing, older adults tend to either lack access to these technologies or the skills and experience necessary to use them effectively. Once online, older adults face the additional challenge of being outsized targets of misinformation and scams, both of which abound in the context of COVID-19. In this essay, we discuss the challenges faced by older adults in their use of digital media for social connection in the present pandemic, as well as highlight some of the population’s untapped strengths which can be leveraged to help them live prosperous online lives. Finally, we provide recommendations for actions which key stakeholders can take to support older adults in this pursuit.",COVID-19 | digital literacy | misinformation | older adults | social media,,"Alhariri S., (2020, April 10).

The implications are much beyond just health crisis, and it has long-lasting psychosocial and economic implications. Although the psychological offshoots such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and sleep disturbances are being studied in-depth, there is a dearth of literature on the sexual well-being and sexual practices during this pandemic. Considering the physical distancing; travel restrictions; the high human-human transmission rate; misinformation and uncertainty about the sexual routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2; and fear about intimacy, sexuality, and safe sexual practices have increased significantly. This is more prominent in newly settled or distanced couples and the frontline health workers, with increased risk exposure to the virus. For them, guilt and distress associated with sexual relationships might increase primary psychiatric and sexual disorders. This, in turn, impacts relationships and emotional bonding in couples and affects healthy coping during the pandemic crisis. Although sexual abstinence is the safest practice to prevent transmission, it is not practically feasible in all cases. Risk reduction counseling, sex with quarantined partners, and digital sex are other options that are worth exploring. There are additional concerns of digital safety, unhealthy use of technology, cyber-crimes, and online extortion. Keeping this in the background, this advocacy article glances through the effects of past outbreaks on sexuality, reviews the current recommendations, and proposes methods and approaches for sexual well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is vital for overall public health.",Coronavirus | COVID-19 | intimacy | pandemic | sex | sexuality,,"World Health Organization.

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. Results: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. Conclusions: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.",5G | Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Fake news | Misinformation | Pandemic | Public health | Social media | Social network analysis | Twitter,"Betacoronavirus | Communication | Coronavirus Infections | Fraud | Humans | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral | Public Health | Public Opinion | Social Media | Social Networking | Truth Disclosure | United Kingdom","Jolly G.

This research develops a multi-level influence model to explore how cybercriminals are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing situational factors, identifying victims, impersonating trusted sources, selecting attack methods, and employing social engineering techniques. The model extends upon prior work on influence techniques and emotional appeals that cybercriminals employ, by bringing into sharper focus the role of situational factors in COVID-19 related cybercrime attacks. Content and thematic analysis was conducted on 185 distinct COVID-19 cybercrime scam incident documents, including text, images, and photos, provided by a global online fraud and cybersecurity company tracking COVID-19 related cybercrime. The analysis reveals interesting patterns about the sheer breadth and diversity of COVID-19 related cybercrime and how these crimes are continually evolving in response to changing situational factors. It is hoped that these insights and recommendations for end-users and organisations can contribute to a safer digital world as we cope with many other pressing challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 | cybercrime | cybersecurity | infodemic | Kieran Conboy | Michael Myers | pandemic | Pär Ågerfalk | social engineering,Attack methods | Cyber security | Cybercriminals | Digital world | Influence model | Situational factors | Social engineering | Thematic analysis,"Abbasi, A., Zhang, Z., Zimbra, D., & Chen, H., (2010).

Connecting signatures of microphysical particle heating and acceleration processes to macroscale heliospheric structure requires sensitive measurements of electromagnetic fields over a large range of physical scales. The FIELDS instrument, which provides PSP with in situ measurements of electromagnetic fields of the inner heliosphere and corona, includes a set of three vector magnetometers: two fluxgate magnetometers (MAGs) and a single inductively coupled search-coil magnetometer (SCM). Together, the three FIELDS magnetometers enable measurements of the local magnetic field with a bandwidth ranging from DC to 1 MHz. This manuscript reports on the development of a merged data set combining SCM and MAG (SCaM) measurements, enabling a high fidelity data product with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. On-ground characterization tests of complex instrumental responses and noise floors are discussed as well as application to the in-flight calibration of FIELDS data. The algorithm used on PSP/FIELDS to merge waveform observations from multiple sensors with optimal signal-to-noise characteristics is presented. In-flight analysis of calibrations and merging algorithm performance demonstrates a timing accuracy to well within the survey rate sample period of ∼340 μs.",,,"Acuna, M. (1974).

In light of the individual's global health crises such as the rapid spread of the epidemic at the level of the world and the outbreak of the epidemic in various proportions, any criminal and unlawful behavior leads to prejudice to the health of the individual and his right to access to medication and treatment in a legal and consistent manner with the necessary specifications and norms The pharmacy will inevitably lead to great losses especially at the level of human resources. Perhaps this leads us to address the questions posed by the study are: What is the extent of keeping pace with international and national obligations of global events in the field of pharmacy in a way that makes them more effective in achieving a balance between eliminating crimes of counterfeit pharmaceutical products, especially in the context of the spread of a pandemic, as a benefit 19 and between achieving effective protection for those affected, so that they have the right to protect Their?

While in India, greater than 9000 positive cases and 308 deaths are reported. People in many countries, all over the world, are locked down to their houses, and policies are implemented to avoid the spread of corona virus. But looking at this scenario, in other perspective reveals dif-ferent knowledge. As, the roads are not crowded, and the malls, transport, institutes, and industries are closed, there is significant improvement in the climate. The present study intends to review these positive changes in climate, and the lessons human should learn from the pandemic, COVID-19. The data related to the effect of human interactions on nature, and the results of lock-down was collected from international newspapers, scholarly articles from peer reviewed journals, and WHO database. The data showed that, after lock-down, there is improvement in the quality of air, the green house gas emission has significantly reduced, and amount of industrial wastes poured in rivers has dropped down, making the water clearer. The nature heals itself, with less human interactions, and worsens with more. So, we must make policies not to damage it further, with our interactions.",Air quality | Climate | Corona Virus | COVID-19 | Crime | Ganga | Seismic Noise | Water quality,,"BBC Future 2020.

Mobile Money has grown significantly, especially post demonetization, enabled by 'smart devices' such as smartphones, smartwatches, smart cards, toll payment devices, and voice-enabled products deploying the Internet of Things (loT). The ease and simplicity of payments through IoT devices are set to change the shopping experience and consequently retail permanently. The government of India's Digital India program is further likely to transform the entire nation into a digitally enabled society as well as a knowledge economy. Mobile money is becoming an essential tool for financial inclusion to unite the unbanked communities of rural India. Internet was introduced in India in 1995, and the first wave of e-commerce began soon after that. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart solutions are noticeable in the growth of mobile payments in India in dual ways, firstly in reducing fraud in high-risk mobile payments and secondly in improved Peer to Peer (P2P) Payment Platforms. Mobile payments through AI solutions is just one illustration of technology that is broadly used today, and that has already started advancing the FinTech industry forward for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This embarks on a sound period of digital inclusion leading to mobile and internet connectivity, with the overall growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks in India. A dynamic force for next-generation e-commerce is the fast-multiplication of mobile phones, handheld computers, mobile devices and PDAs. Mobile commerce demonstrates a sea change in consumer behavior in India. This study aims to examine the growth and effect of mobile payments in India, where mobile penetration is the second highest in the world, after China. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the digital payments segment in India are noteworthy.. Like other economies of the world, the adverse effects of the pandemic are pervading to significant sectors of the Indian economy including retail trade, aviation, hospitality, entertainment industry, restaurants, clubs and entertainment parks. All of these sectors are experiencing the burden of the slowdown. In contrast, the digital payments sector comprising of groceries, online money transfer, Over The Top - OTT streaming media services, online gaming, online education is experiencing a boost.

The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19 related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive institutionalism, that the EU’s response to Covid-19 in the field of cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence that emerged in the 1980s.",Covid-19 | Discursive institutionalism | EU cyber security policy | privatisation,,"Carrapico, H., and B., Farrand. 2017. “ ‘Dialogue, Partnership and Empowerment for Network and Information Security’: The Changing Role of the Private Sector from Objects of Regulation to Regulation Shapers.” Crime Law Society Change 67 (3): 245–263. doi: 10.1007/s10611-016-9652-4. ; Commission Recommendation 2020/518, 2020. “ On a Common Union Toolbox for the Use of Technology and Data to Combat and Exit from the Covid-19 Crisis, in Particular Concerning Mobile Applications and the Use of Anonymised Mobility Data.” ; Council of the European Union. 1997 “ Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime (No. No C251/1-15.8.97).” Official Journal of the European Communities,1.

This adaptability varies across policy areas under study. Inter-crisis learning has been higher in state aid and economic governance than in the area of Schengen. Discursive shifts co-exist and have been central to the areas of cybercrime, economic governance and climate change. Additionally, and despite the tensions, there are signs of renewed political commitment to the European project and an acceleration of decisions and initiatives that had been decided or discussed before the pandemic. Although de-politicization and politicization trends continue to co-exist, we observe politicization at the top with European elites perceiving the Covid-19 emergency as an existential threat for the EU. Finally, we argue that the EU’s adaptability and acceleration of prior trends do not necessarily involve a race that favor supranational tendencies.",,,"Bauer, M.

Cross C.,55849846700,Theorising the impact of COVID-19 on the fraud victimisation of older persons,2020,Journal of Adult Protection,23,2,,98,109,,1,10.1108/JAP-08-2020-0035,,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how COVID-19 may alter the vulnerability levels of older persons, and how this may change their potential for fraud victimisation. This is particularly focused on the government’s use of isolation, restrictions on activity and physical distancing to combat the virus. Design/methodology/approach: In the absence of statistics, this paper examines what is currently known about older persons and fraud, as well as the recent knowledge of COVID-19-related fraud. On this basis, the paper hypothesises the conceivable changes to vulnerability that potentially expose older persons to fraud. Findings: This paper argues that COVID-19 has not seen “new” fraudulent approaches, rather offenders have used COVID-19 as a context to their existing schemes. Further, the current response to COVID-19 can substantially increase the number of older persons experiencing levels of vulnerability, and therefore increase their fraud risk. Research limitations/implications: The current paper applies existing knowledge into the current circumstances of COVID-19 and lays the foundations for empirical work to be conducted in this area. Practical implications: This paper provides an impetus to target the well-being and connectivity of older persons, (regardless of the COVID-19 context), to reduce their vulnerability to fraud victimisation. Social implications: This paper highlights the importance of connectivity for older persons, and the need to focus on overcoming social isolation and loneliness. Originality/value: This paper is the first to hypothesise the effects of COVID-19 and its associated government responses to the overall vulnerability of older persons, with a focus on the potential for fraud victimisation.",COVID-19 | Cybercrime | Fraud | Older persons | Victimisation | Vulnerability,,"ActionFraud (2020), “Cyber experts shine light on online scams as British public flag over 160,000 suspect emails”, available at: www.actionfraud.police.uk/news/cyber-experts-shine-light-on-online-scams-as-british-public-flag-over-160000-suspect-emails (accessed 5 August 2020). ; Alves, L. and Wilson, S.

One important challenge we face is to efficiently and effectively use recently gathered data and find computational tools to combat the COVID-19 infodemic, a typical information overloading problem. Novel coronavirus presents many questions without ready answers; its uncertainty and our eagerness in search of solutions offer a fertile environment for infodemic. It is thus necessary to combat the infodemic and make a concerted effort to confront COVID-19 and mitigate its negative impact in all walks of life when saving lives and maintaining normal orders during trying times. In this position paper of combating the COVID-19 infodemic, we illustrate its need by providing real-world examples of rampant conspiracy theories, misinformation, and various types of scams that take advantage of human kindness, fear, and ignorance. We present three key challenges in this fight against the COVID-19 infodemic where researchers and practitioners instinctively want to contribute and help. We demonstrate that these challenges can and will be effectively addressed by collective wisdom, crowd sourcing, and collaborative research.",,Collaborative research | Computational tools | Coronaviruses | Information overloading | Position papers | Real-world,"Mohammad-Ali Abbasi and Huan Liu.

As industries explore transitioning away from shared touch devices, the role of voice biometrics for authentication becomes critical. Voice biometrics is utilized for voice recognition through analysis of an individual’s pitch, speech, voice, and tone and has been used in back-office operations for customer verification, fraud avoidance, and password reset. However, not much research has been done in the consumer sector and the critical role of trust in driving usage and the adoption of such services. Using the existing research on trust in e-commerce and automation, we bring together models from psychology (Theory of Planned Behaviour) and technology (Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence), to explore the various antecedents of consumer trust for voice authentication (Ease of use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, reliability, the perceived reputation of the service provider, perceived security, perceived privacy, fraud, and social influence). Special attention is given to the use of vernacular voice, two-step authentication, and their impact on trust. Speaker recognition is a pattern recognition problem and incudes various technologies like frequency estimation, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, pattern matching algorithms, neural networks, decision trees, and linear predictive coding. Through a combination of custom build prototypes, usage scenarios, and qualitative and quantitative analysis, we intend to highlight the components that drive trust for voice authentication so that it can help in the societal transition to contactless interactions. Early results show that people value Security, Privacy, and Reliability as top factors impacting trust in Voice Biometrics. Multi-level authentication, vernacular voice, and initial usage for transactional and low-value financial transactions can help drive trust in the voice biometrics ecosystem.",Artificial intelligence | Contactless | Covid-19 | Human-machine interaction | Voice biometrics,Back-office operations | Financial transactions | Linear Predictive Coding | Multi-level authentications | Pattern matching algorithms | Pattern recognition problems | Qualitative and quantitative analysis | Theory of planned behaviour,"ABI Research: COVID-19 Will Drive Global Contactless Payment Card Issuance Above the 2 Billion Mark in 2020.

White A.,57220209891,May you live in interesting times: a reflection on academic integrity and accounting assessment during COVID19 and online learning,2020,Accounting Research Journal,,,,,,,0,10.1108/ARJ-09-2020-0317,,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the shift of assessments online and the potential impact on academic integrity and misconduct. The rapid pivot to online teaching as a result of COVID19 and our experiences in the accounting academy is the embodiment of the phrase “may you live in interesting times”. As teaching and learning activities shifted online, so did assessment of student learning. A topic of great discussion amongst faculty is whether accounting exams should be invigilated online and whether exams should be used at all to assess student learning. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses personal reflections and experiences to analyse the tensions between the risk of academic misconduct, maintaining assessment security and accreditation requirements of professional accounting bodies during the shift of assessment tasks online in 2020. These tensions are analysed using the fraud triangle framework (Cressey, 1973). Findings: Students face incentives and pressures to engage in misconduct, opportunities that arise from online learning and assessment, and hold complex perceptions around their attitudes towards academic integrity and rationalisations of misconduct behaviour. Originality/value: Suggestions are made as to how the accounting academy can move forward, taking advantages of online assessment, while still ensuring that our graduates are meeting the competencies required to join the accounting profession.",Academic integrity | Academic misconduct | Online assessment | Online exams | Online invigilation | Online proctoring,,"Bearman, M., Dawson, P., O’Donnell, M., Tai, J. and Jorre de St Jorre, T.

Recent events connected to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted how the risks and consequences of this are no longer acceptable. Two papers, addressing the treatment of COVID-19, have been published in two of the most prestigious medical journals; the authors declared to have analysed electronic health records from a private corporation, which apparently collected data of tens of thousands of patients, coming from hundreds of hospitals. Both papers have been retracted a few weeks later. When such events happen, the confidence of the population in scientific research is likely to be weakened. This paper highlights how the current system endangers the reliability of scientific research, and the very foundations of the trust system on which modern healthcare is based. Having shed light on the dangers of a system without appropriate monitoring, the proposed analysis suggests to strengthen the existing journal policies and improve the research process using new technologies supporting control activities by public authorities. Among these solutions, we mention the promising aspects of the blockchain technology which seems a promising solution to avoid the repetition of the mistakes linked to the recent and past history of research.",professional misconduct | public health ethics | publication ethics | research ethics | scientific research,,"Callaway E.

Most real-world time series data have a spatial dimension as an additional context which is often expressed in terms of coordinates of the region of interest (such as latitude - longitude information). However, existing techniques are limited to handle spatial and temporal contextual attributes in an integrated and meaningful way considering both spatial and temporal dependency between observations. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning framework is proposed to solve the unsupervised anomaly detection problem in multivariate spatio-temporal data. The proposed framework works with unlabeled data and no prior knowledge about anomalies are assumed. As a case study, we use the public COVID-19 data provided by the Italian Department of Civil Protection. Northern Italy regions’ COVID-19 data are used to train the framework; and then any abnormal trends or upswings in COVID-19 data of central and southern Italian regions are detected. The proposed framework detects early signals of the COVID-19 outbreak in test regions based on the reconstruction error. For performance comparison, we perform a detailed evaluation of 15 algorithms on the COVID-19 Italy dataset including the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Experimental results show that our framework shows significant improvement on unsupervised anomaly detection performance even in data scarce and high contamination ratio scenarios (where the ratio of anomalies in the data set is more than 5%). It achieves the earliest detection of COVID-19 outbreak and shows better performance on tracking the peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic in test regions. As the timeliness of detection is quite important in the fight against any outbreak, our framework provides useful insight to suppress the resurgence of local novel coronavirus outbreaks as early as possible.",COVID-19 | Deep learning | Italy | Multivariate | Outbreak detection | Spatio-temporal anomaly detection | Unsupervised,Learning architectures | Learning frameworks | Performance comparison | Real-world time series | Reconstruction error | Region of interest | Spatio-temporal data | Unsupervised anomaly detection,"M.

However, recognizing credit card fraudulent transaction is still an open problem despite many methods have been proposed. The main problems, among others, are imbalanced nature of the credit card transaction data and no agreed upon features to represent the transaction. This paper presents a novel approach to address such problem by exploiting card user spending behavior as the main feature to represent the transaction. in our experiment with Random forest we put max features parameter value 18 and 75 as number of trees in Random forest. While our experiment with OCSVM is by using 4 different kernels which are RBF, Polynomial, Linear and Sigmoid, and, we tuned nu and gamma parameter to get the optimal precision, recall and AUC for our Classifier. The experiment results found that One-Class SVM model achieve 0.984 AUC for training and 0.985 AUC for testing; whilst, Random Forest model achieves 0.991 AUC for training and 0.943 AUC for testing.",Anomaly detection | Bagging | Machine learning | One-Class SVM | Random forest,,"A.

Amid the coronavirus disease pandemic, the world is witnessing the greatest natural experiment ever, and countries have adopted different response strategies. An evaluation of the effectiveness of different policies will play a valuable role in preparing for future public health emergencies. However, controversial issues such as the timing and pathways of viral emergence, the effectiveness of social distancing and lockdown strategies, and the use of antimalarial drugs as therapy have still not been fully resolved. This serves as a fertile breeding ground for agnotological strategies, whereby scientific studies are deliberately or unintentionally designed to create distractions or draw conclusions that are not supported by research findings. Researchers, public health authorities, and healthcare workers should be equipped to identify such agnotological strategies, distinguish them from scientific fraud, and avoid drawing misleading inferences based on an irrational adherence to hypotheses and a lack of criticism of implausible results.",Coronavirus disease | Epidemiology | Knowledge | Philosophy,"Betacoronavirus | Coronavirus Infections | Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice | Humans | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral | Research Design | Scientific Misconduct","Popper KR.

It thereafter draws on the disproportionate policy perspective to ascertain the ideas and sensitivities that placed key policy responses on trajectories which prioritized differential policy responses over general, nation-wide solutions (and vice versa), even though data in the public domain supported the selection of opposing policy solutions on epidemiological or social welfare grounds. The article also gauges the consequences and implications of the policy choices made in the fight against COVID-19 for the disproportionate policy perspective. It argues that Prime Minister Netanyahu employed disproportionate policy responses both at the rhetorical level and on the ground in the fight against COVID-19; that during the crisis, Netanyahu enjoyed wide political leeway to employ disproportionate policy responses, and the general public exhibited a willingness to tolerate this; and (iii) that ascertaining the occurrence of disproportionate policy responses is not solely a matter of perception.",Covid-19 | Disproportionate response | Israel | netanyahu | overreaction | rhetoric | underreaction,,"Baumgartner, F.

Esoimeme E.E.,57205027873,Identifying and reducing the money laundering risks posed by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as money rules,2020,Journal of Money Laundering Control,24,1,,201,212,,0,10.1108/JMLC-05-2020-0053,,"Purpose: This paper aims to help build awareness with financial institutions about the money laundering risks posed by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules and theme assures that financial institution scan adopt to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as “Money Mules”. Design/methodology/approach: The research took the form of a desk study, which analysed various documents and reports such as a 2019 report on Money Mules by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL); a 2019 and 2020 report on Money Mules by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Better Business Bureau (BBB); the Financial Action Task Force Guidance on the Risk Based Approach to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (High Level Principles and Procedures) 2007; the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations 2012; the United Kingdom’s Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017; the United States Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual 2014; Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2018; The UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended); the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part I June 2017 (Amended December 2017); the United States Codified Bank Secrecy Act Regulations (31 CFR); the Nigerian Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 (as amended); and the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part II: Sectoral Guidance June 2017 (Amended December 2017). Findings: This paper determined that financial institutions may be able to prevent proceeds of crime from being laundered by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules if they focus monitoring resources on the emotionally vulnerable customers like newcomers to the country, unemployed people who may have lost their jobs because of a pandemic like COVID-19, students and those in economic hardship; pay very close attention to the country of origin where the funds emanate from; pay very close attention to the country where the funds are being transferred to; and pay close attention to frequent large cash deposits followed by wire transfers. Originality/value: While most articles focus on the money laundering risk(s) associated with Money Mules and the measures that individuals can use to ensure that their bank accounts are not used by criminals to launder illicit funds, this paper focuses on the different mechanisms that banks can use to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as “Money Mules”. This paper recommends a proportional approach that balances anti-money laundering measures, financial inclusion and human rights. The mechanisms/measures which have been extensively discussed in this paper will help banks to identify, assess and understand their money laundering and terrorist financing risks as it relates to Money Mules and take commensurate measures to mitigate them.",Bitcoins | COVID-19 | Cybercrime | Financial institutions | Money laundering | Money mules,,"Better Business Bureau (2019), “Fall in love – go to jail: BBB report on how some romance fraud victims become money mules”, available at: https://www.bbb.org/globalassets/local-bbbs/st-louis-mo-142/st_louis_mo_142/studies/fall-in-love-go-to-jail-bbb-report-on-how-some-romance-fraud-victims-become-money-mules-final-02-09-2019.pdf (accessed 25 December 2019). ; British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) (2019), “US names Nigerians in massive fraud investigation”, available at: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49446845 (accessed 25 November 2019). ; Federal Bureau of Investigation (2020), “FBI warns of money mule schemes exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic”, available at: https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-warns-of-money-mule-schemes-exploiting-the-covid-19-pandemic (accessed 29 April 2020). ; Federal Bureau of Investigation (2017), “Romance scams: online imposters break hearts and bank accounts”, available at: https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/romance-scams (accessed 28 December 2019). ; Federal Bureau of Investigation (2019), “Cyber actors use online dating sites to conduct confidence/romance fraud and recruit money mules”, available at: https://www.ic3.gov/media/2019/190805.aspx (accessed 28 December 2019). ; Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (2014), “Bank secrecy act/anti-money laundering examination manual”, available at: https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/documents/BSA_AML_Man_2014_v2.pdf (accessed 20 February 2017). ; Financial Action Task Force (2019), “Procedures for the FATF fourth round of AML/CFT mutual evaluations”, available at: https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/content/images/FATF-4th-Round-Procedures.pdf (accessed 28 December 2019). ; Financial Action Task Force (2020), “Consolidated assessment ratings”, available at: https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/4th-Round-Ratings.pdf (accessed 13 January 2020). ; KrebsonSecurity (2016), “Money mule’ gangs turn to bitcoin ATMs”, available at: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/money-mule-gangs-turn-to-bitcoin-atms/ (accessed 4 January 2020). ; Passas, N.

This paper aims to investigate the potential of innovative regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial region focused on the steel and mining industry by means of the local currency. Being the important players of local economies and regional development, SMEs have always been in the center of interest for practitioners of the local and community currencies. Therefore, our research team analyzed and explored major benefits and barriers that SMEs perceive to adopt and use local currency. In parallel with the specified aims, the researchers employed the structured questionnaire survey with open and dichotomous questions focused on SMEs with no practical experience with the acceptance and use od the local or community currencies in Cieszyn Silesia region. The results of our research show that SMEs are prone to be active members of local currency communities, and they positively perceive the support that major regional producers, service providers, and practitioners can provide for them through this instrument. Moreover, some SMEs also perceive local currencies as a marketing and promotion tool that increases product-service quality and mutual transactions of firms. According to the respondents, high participation fees and exchange rates, lack of usage by customers and coverage by national currencies, counterfeiting, and fraud, liquidity risk, taxability, accountability, legislative and technical issues, credibility and trustworthiness of practitioners have been main impediments in the adoption and usage of these currencies by SMEs. This research provides innovative solutions and suggestions for policymakers in case of the regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial regions to overcome the barriers of local currencies. Since local currencies can be created in digital formats, the increasing importance of local digital currencies in the Covid-19 pandemic has also been highlighted.",Benefits | Cieszyn Silesia region | Community currency | Covid-19 | Digital currency | Local currency | Obstacles | Regional development | SMEs,,"Abraham, J., Sutiksno, D.

This paper helps individuals and industry by reviewing the most common coronavirus social engineering attacks and provides recommendations for responding to such an attack. The paper also discusses the psychology behind social engineering and introduces security awareness as a solution to reduce the risk of social engineering attacks.",Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Cybersecurity | Human security behavior | Phishing | Scams | Security awareness | Smishing | Social engineering | Vishing | Working remotely,,"N.

Background. The beginning of 2020 has been marked by a historic event of worldwide importance: the Coronavirus pandemic. This emergency has resulted in severe global problems affecting areas such as healthcare and the social and economic fields. What about crime? Purpose of the work. The purpose of this work is to reflect about Italy and its crime rate at the time of Coronavirus. Methods. Some crimes will be analysed (the “conventional” ones only, ruling out health-related offences) in the light of data resulting from Ministries and Europol reports, as well as from newspapers and news. Results and conclusions. The outcome will be explained, and some criminological remarks will be added.",COVID-19 | Crime rate | Italy | Pandemic,"Betacoronavirus | Coronavirus Infections | Crime | Humans | Italy | Pandemics | Pneumonia, Viral","Travaini G, Viggiani C.

Despite this approach being successfully employed in ophthalmology and having great potential in forensic cases, its use in different forensic fields appears to be quite limited. In this review we reviewed the scientific literature regarding the application of OCT in forensic science and legal medicine from 1995 to 2019. Our research showed the usefulness of this approach for the study of coronary injuries, postmortem ocular changes, forensic entomology, and several other applications of specific forensic interest (the study of blood stains, fingerprints, and hair bulbs for personal identification, as well as the study of materials found in the crime scene for comparation, or anti-fraud investigation). The creation of specific ‘ad hoc’ devices and a better knowledge of this type of technology by pathologists will be a fundamental step to continue to develop the use of OCT forensic fields.",Forensic entomology | Forensic imaging | Forensic pathology | OCT in forensic science | Optical coherence tomography | Postmortem ocular changes,"Animals | Arthropods | Blood Stains | Coronary Vessels | Dermatoglyphics | Entomology | Eye | Forensic Sciences | Hair | Heart | Humans | Postmortem Changes | Tomography, Optical Coherence","Roberts IS, Benamore RE, Benbow EW, Lee SH, Harris JN, Jackson A, et al.

These have been used to great effect in various real-world applications including handwriting recognition, face detection, image search, and fraud prevention. We sought to retrain a robust CNN with coronal computed tomography (CT) images to classify osteomeatal complex (OMC) occlusion and assess the performance of this technology with rhinologic data. Methods: The Google Inception-V3 CNN trained with 1.28 million images was used as the base model. Preoperative coronal sections through the OMC were obtained from 239 patients enrolled in 2 prospective chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) outcomes studies, labeled according to OMC status, and mirrored to obtain a set of 956 images. Using this data, the classification layer of Inception-V3 was retrained in Python using a transfer learning method to adapt the CNN to the task of interpreting sinonasal CT images. Results: The retrained neural network achieved 85% classification accuracy for OMC occlusion, with a 95% confidence interval for algorithm accuracy of 78% to 92%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on the test set confirmed good classification ability of the CNN with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.87, significantly different than both random guessing and a dominant classifier that predicts the most common class (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Current state-of-the-art CNNs may be able to learn clinically relevant information from 2-dimensional sinonasal CT images with minimal supervision. Future work will extend this approach to 3-dimensional images in order to further refine this technology for possible clinical applications.",chronic disease | convolutional neural network | machine learning | neural network | sinusitis,"Adult | Artificial Intelligence | Automation, Laboratory | Chronic Disease | Female | Humans | Inflammation | Male | Nasal Obstruction | Neural Networks, Computer | Paranasal Sinuses | Prospective Studies | Rhinitis | Sinusitis | Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Batra PS, Setzen M, Li Y, Han JK, Setzen G.

The immunohistochemical staining and in vitro experiments showed that deficiency of vinexin β inhibited the accumulation of monocytes and the migration of macrophages induced by tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as macrophage proliferation. Finally, the inhibitory effects exerted by vinexin β deficiency on foam cell formation, nuclear factor κB activation, and inflammatory cytokine expression were largely reversed by constitutive Akt activation, whereas the increased expression of the nuclear factor jB subset promoted by adenoviral vinexin β was dramatically suppressed by inhibition of AKT. Conclusions-Vinexin β deficiency attenuates atherogenesis primarily by suppressing vascular inflammation and inactivating Akt-nuclear factor κB signaling.

Food adulteration is a serious problem worldwide not just because it is a fraud to consumer, but it can also harm the health and causes serious consequences to the well being of people. Among the food products, edible oil has been identified as the top ingredient involved in food fraud. Studies show that adulteration in fats and oils are mainly economically motivated and in some cases intended to enhance food flavor. In general, adulteration of edible oil causes two great concerns to the consumer. First, it concerns consumers that practice vegetarian diet or followers of religions that prohibit from consuming pig, pork or any of its products. Second, it may cause serious health related issues particularly those who have allergies to certain types of substances or consumers who suffer coronary disease. Several conventional techniques have been utilized in order to study food adulteration particularly on fats and oil, such as polymerase chain reaction, differential scanning calorimetry, electronic nose and chromatography. Until recently, dielectric spectroscopy technique that have been widely used to analyze food products, attain research community’s attention in the study of adulteration on fats and oil. In this chapter, a review on conventional techniques and dielectric spectroscopy approach for analyzing food products are presented. In particular, a review on dielectric spectroscopy to study adulteration in fats and oils and recent work on lard detection at both low and high frequency range are discussed. Results show that dielectric sensing can be a great technology to detect lard adulterated edible oil and applying data analysis technique can further enhance the detection ability.",,Conventional techniques | Coronary disease | Data analysis techniques | Detection ability | Dielectric sensing | Food adulterations | Low and high frequencies | Research communities,"J.

One reason, noted by others, is the lack of reproducibility of studies and the problems with accuracy and rigor. However, another reason for translational failure has not been emphasized by others, that is, the lack of state-of-the-art cardiovascular measurements, because of effects of anesthesia, lack of direct measurements of cardiovascular function, and problems of species differences. In part, this is because of the impact of molecular medicine on traditional physiology, which not only affects priority for publication in top-tier journals, but also funding priorities for National Institutes of Health (NIH) study sections, resulting in the closure of almost all cardiovascular physiology laboratories, leaving the cardiovascular physiology in many molecular publications to incidental data that are not peer-reviewed and in many cases are inaccurate.

The photonic structures found on these species that show these properties are multilayered spherical cavities or triangular grooves which polarize the light due to multiple inner reflections. These polarization effects, in addition to the intrinsic color-mixing properties of these photonic structures, are of interest in the anti-counterfeiting field due to their invisibility to the naked eye. In this paper, we report micro-fabrication techniques to produce bio-inspired cylindrical grooves (C-grooves) and triangular grooves (V-grooves) that demonstrate the same properties. Theoretical analyses were carried out by using multi-scale simulation (MS) as well as by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) in order to compare the polarization capability of both structures. The V-grooves show greater polarization contrast than the C-grooves, but the spectrum is specular. The C-grooves exhibit lower polarization effects but have a dispersive spectrum. In both cases, the structures show additional optical properties, such as diffraction, macroscopic color contrast under a polarizer, and contrast inversion due to geometries which contribute to their uniqueness.",ALD | Anti-counterfeiting | Bio-inspiration | Blumei | Polarization,"ALD | Anti-counterfeiting | Bio-inspiration | Blumei | Finite -difference time domains (FDTD) | Micro-fabrication techniques | Multi-scale simulation | Polarization rotation | Animals | Biomimetic Materials | Fraud | Insects | Light | Materials Testing | Refractometry | Scattering, Radiation | Wings, Animal","Kotacka L, Tethal T and KolarikV2005 Top-quality security optical elements: from holography towards 500.000 dpi Congress on Optics and Optoelectronics 59540 ; Yan P, Fei G T, Su Y, Shang G L, Li H,Wu B de Zhang L 2011 Anti-counterfeiting of one-dimensional alumina photonic crystal by creating defects Electrochem.

Three spectrophotometers were evaluated for this purpose: two monochromator instruments (Foss NIRSystems 6500 SY-I and Foss NIRSystems 6500 SY-II; spectral range 400-2,500 nm in both cases) and a diode-array instrument (Corona 45 VIS/NIR; spectral range 380-1,700 nm). A total of 70 samples were used to predict major chemical quality parameters (total acidity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, pH, dry extract, ash, acetoin, methanol, total polyphenols, color (tonality and intensity), and alcohol content), and to construct models for the classification of vinegars as a function of the manufacturing method used. The results obtained indicate that this non-invasive technology can be used successfully by the vinegar industry and by PDO regulators for the routine analysis of vinegars in order to authenticate them and to detect potential fraud. Slightly better results were achieved with the two monochromator instruments. The findings also highlight the potential of these NIR instruments for predicting the manufacturing process used, this being of particular value for the industrial authentication of traditional wine vinegars. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Authentication | NIR spectroscopy | Quality parameters | Wine vinegar,,"Anklam, E.

Indeed, over the last 15 years, the USA has distantly surpassed most countries in the developed world in total healthcare expenditures per capita with the USA now spending 17.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare ($7960 per capita), compared with only 8.5% of GDP in Japan ($2878 per capita), a distant second. Consequently, by current projections, the US healthcare bill will have ballooned from $2.5 trillion in 2009 to over $4.6 trillion by 2020. Such spending growth rates are unsustainable and the system would soon go broke if not corrected. The drivers of these spending growth rates in US healthcare are several and varied. Indeed, in September 2012, the Institute of Medicine reported that US healthcare squandered $750 billion in 2009 through unneeded care, Byzantine paperwork, fraud and other wasteful activities. Recently, the question was raised as to whether we have too much coronary angioplasty in the USA. In this analysis, we examine these and other various related aspects of US healthcare, make comparisons with other national healthcare delivery systems, and suggest several reengineering modalities to help fix these compellingly glaring glitches and maladies of US healthcare.",,Angioplasty | Delivery of Health Care | Humans | Medicine | United States | Unnecessary Procedures,"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Goldberg D.M.,34975081800,Science at the crossroads: Fact or fiction?,2011,Journal of Medical Biochemistry,30,2,,79,92,,4,10.2478/v10011-011-0004-8,,"Modern Academic Science is largely based on the formulation of hypotheses that are then confirmed through observations and experiments. There is little scope for curiosity that played an important role in early Science. Results carrying negative implications are not easy to publish, and hypotheses have a tendency to take on the mantra of religious beliefs. Academic Science is facing on many fronts pressures that hardly existed in the past. Financial rewards apart from salary can be very high, in the form of fees for consultants, expert legal witnesses, patent development, and even the establishment of private companies. Commercial funding forms a significant percentage of the Total Research Budgets in Science and Medicine, but this often leads to loss of control over research protocols and freedom to communicate the results. Media attention confers fame and prestige that is assiduously sought out by some individual scientists, often supported by University resources, and Press Conferences prior to or synchronous with actual publication. Scientists have long been employed full-time by Government Departments, but research contracts are being increasingly offered by the latter to academic staff on a part-time basis. These pressures and opportunities, together with the priority given to research by most University Tenure and Promotion Committees, are tending to diminish the appetite of scientists for other important responsibilities such as teaching and administration. In a few decades, University scientists have moved from the Ivory Tower to the High Street, and many are serving more than one master. The above scenario may bring increased remuneration and the pursuit of research that would be too expensive without these external sources, but adverse consequences have also occurred. They may lead to the complicity of scientists, through no fault of their own, in the introduction of drugs and supplements that: a) fail to deliver the benefits claimed; b) increase the risk of some unrelated illness; c) possess dangerous side effects not known or reported at the time of introduction. Examples include hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant vitamins (A and E) to protect against Coronary Heart Disease; dietary fibre to prevent colon cancer; and arguably calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis. On occasions, academic scientists have served as fronts for the publication by the manufacturers of falsified reports minimizing the risk of serious drug side-effects to ensure Regulatory Approval, as occurred with Vioxx in the treatment of arthritis, and Seroquel for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Individual fraud or misconduct is more frequent than suspected, because most incidents are without major impact and are suppressed by Universities and Funding Agencies. Major scandals are rare, but may have serious repercussions for the general public and bring science into disrepute. Recent examples include: the Cold Fusion controversy (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction); the link age by Andrew Wakefield of autism with Rubella vaccination; the infamous creation of stem cells by somatic cell nuclear transfer falsely reported by Hwang Woo-Suk. Fraud by commercial companies is subject to the full force of the law, but Science is treated as a self-regulating profession, and as such the punishments handed out are relatively trivial. In essence, Science prior to 1950, except in North America, proceeded along a highway that segregated the traffic into Commercial, Government and Academic streams, and passed through inspiring landscapes and green pastures. It later came to a crossroads from which the alternative road led to the Marketplace, and on which segregation into the above three streams was not enforced. It has now become the main thoroughfare for Science world-wide, but there are reasons to believe that this has increased the incidence of dangerous driving and traffic accidents in the form of conflicts of interest, unethical behaviour, misconduct and even fraud. It may be too late to return to the crossroads and continue along the original highway, but there could be considerable merit in restoring the original segregation between the three streams of Science and in developing, as well as enforcing, a stricter code of behaviour, for which some elements are proposed.",antioxidants | cold fusion | dietary fibre | drug development | hormone replacement therapy | regulatory approval | rubella vaccine | scientific fraud | stem cells,,"Farthing MJG.

This subspecialty now has a dedicated professional society, recently published guidelines, and plans for standardized certification. This paradigm shift represents a major collaboration opportunity for our specialty. The rise of evidence-based perioperative practice has produced a culture of large trials in our specialty to search for solutions to the challenging outcome questions. Besides the growth in the development of evidence, the consensus conference format and postpublication peer review have both emerged as effective processes for identifying the most relevant high-quality evidence. The quest for best perioperative practice has highlighted the importance of teamwork at all phases of care with respect to transitions in care, blood component transfusion, and research misconduct. The emergence of ultrasound as a standard for central vascular access also has been emphasized in recent multisociety guidelines. There also has been a paradigm shift in the management of patients with coronary artery disease. Recent guidelines have emphasized the roles of the cardiac anesthesiologist and the interventional cardiologist as part of the heart team approach. Major recent trials in comparative effectiveness have challenged the advantages of percutaneous coronary intervention, off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. The year 2012 has witnessed the emergence of new paradigms of care in our specialty with the emphasis on teamwork, safety, and quality. These processes will further improve perioperative outcome. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",bleeding | cardiothoracic and vascular critical care | comparative effectiveness | coronary artery bypass grafting | coronary artery disease | evidence-based perioperative practice | guidelines | heart team approach | international consensus | intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation | patient safety | percutaneous coronary intervention | percutaneous left ventricular assist device | perioperative protocol | postpublication peer review | randomized trials | research fraud | scientific misconduct | transfusion | transition of care | ultrasound | vascular access,,"P.A.

Daescu M.,55956676800,Tipuri de argumentare în discursul politic al lui Iuliu Maniu (1919-1928),2011,Terra Sebus,3,,,461,476,,0,,,"The study here sets out to lay emphasis on the argumentation technique employed by Iuliu Maniu in his discourse during 1919-1928 when he made his way to the forefront of Romanian inter war political scene. Argumentation represents the underlying factors of discourse cohesion and coherence. By skilful use of supporting arguments he managed to achieve the desired effect of convincing and winning over his audience. Calling attention to the main historical events and developments in the 10 years following the Union of 1918 he makes use of a large spectrum of arguments to legitimize the Union of 1918 and its place in the Romanian political environment, to express the necessity for a Romanian National Party and the establishment of the National Peasants' Party. He also argued why the policy pursued by the National Liberal Party was barely within the limit of what was considered legal and democratic. Making use of historical, lawful and demographic arguments, by virtue of the authority represented by the party whose head he was, Iuliu Maniu seeks to uphold the principles of lawfulness and constitutionalism in Romanian political life. As regards his arguments for the political actions of 1919-1920, when he coordinated the activity of the Supervisory Council (Consiliul Dirigent) and head of government was Alexandru Vaida Voevod, Iuliu Maniu insistes that the acts of the Union of 1918 could be fulfilled only in a climate governed by law and order. Maniu did not consider the role of the Romanian National Party ended upon the conclusion of the Act of 1 December 1918. He argued it was its duty to continue activating on the political scene because its roots draw their sap from the will of the nation and its past force it to work for the installation of true democratic principles, social justice, constitutionalism and genuine parliamentarianism. Iuliu Maniu's discourses also lay emphasis on those arguments that stood behind his and his party's boycott of the Coronation Act of 15 October 1922 in Alba Iulia as well as behind the refusal to vote the Constitution of 1923. His entire line of argumentation starts from the premise that the elections of 1922 were a fraud in favour of the National Liberal Party that wrote a constitution which did not represent the best interest of the nation and the Coronation became a party act. Nevertheless, throughout 1922-1928 his discourse stood under the sign of a never-ending polemics with the Liberal government or those secretly manoeuvred by Ion I.C. Brǎtianu. The choice of themes and words had a pejorative character with the single purpose of highlighting that such governments were illegal and unlawful, against the democratic principles Iuliu Maniu upheld and against the will of the nation.",Constitutionalism | Democracy | Iuliu Maniu | Legality | National Romanian Party | Political discourse,,"Dezbaterile Adunǎrii Deputatilor. ; Aurel Galea, Activitatea Consiliului Dirigent privind aplicarea rezolutiei Marii Adunǎri Nationale de la Alba Iulia din 1Decembrie 1918, în Marisia, XXV, 1996, p. 317-338. ; Aurel Galea, Formarea si activitatea Consiliului Dirigent al Transilvaniei, Banatului si tinuturilor românesti din Ungaria, vol.

Soluble cellular adhesion molecules (sCAMs) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels are also related to ACS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate differences in serum levels of neopterin, sCAMs and MPO between coronary artery disease and metabolic syndrome (CAD-MetS) patients with stable and unstable angina pectoris (SAP, UAP), and to clarify the relationships between neopterin and other biomarkers. The study included 60 patients with CAD-MetS who were classified into two groups, 30 patients with SAP and 30 patients with UAP. Twenty healthy subjects were selected as controls (C). Serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), sE-selectin and MPO levels were measured by Luminex xMAP technology, and serum neopterin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: Serum levels of neopterin, MPO, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, and sE-selectin were significantly higher in patients with UAP in comparison with the group of healthy controls (P < 0.05). Patients with SAP also had higher levels of these biomarkers than those in healthy controls (P < 0.05), except for sE-selectin. The biomarker level did not differ between the two patient groups, except for MPO, which was significantly higher in the USP group (P < 0.05). Neopterin was significantly correlated only with sVCAM-1 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CAD-Met patients with SAP had more apparent raised levels of serum sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, simultaneously with higher MPO and neopterin concentrations, in comparison to those in healthy subjects. However, UAP is also associated with more substantial changes in MPO and significantly increased sE-selectin levels. Neopterin concentration was had a close correlation only with sVCAM-1.",angina pectoris | cellular adhesion molecules | coronary artery disease | metabolic syndrome | myeloperoxidase | neopterin,,"Alam, S.E., Nasser, S.S., Fernainy, K.E., Habib, A.A., Badr, K.F.

To examine the prognostic value of soluble Cellular Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) and highly sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP) on long-term outcome for patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP). Design. In a prospective study, 291 patients referred for coronary angiography due to clinically suspected SAP had serum level of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), sP-selectin and hsCRP determined at baseline. The primary outcome was predefi ned as death from any cause, myocardial infarction or stroke during a mean follow-up of 7.1 years. Results. Thirty four patients experienced the primary outcome. Hazard ratios and 95% confi dence intervals for the primary outcome were: sVCAM-1: 2.4 [1.1-4.9], sICAM-1: 3.3 [1.5-7.2], sP-selectin: 1.2 [0.6-2.6] and hs-CRP: 3.1 [1.5-6.3], when comparing patients in the 4th quartile with those in lower quartiles in a multivariable model. Higher risk of adverse outcome was observed in patients having levels of both hsCRP and sICAM-1 (HR 4.7 [1.7-9.9]) or hsCRP and sVCAM-1 (HR 4.2 [1.7-9.9]) in the 4th quartile. Conclusions. sVCAM-1, sICAM-1 and hsCRP were signifi cantly associated with long term outcomes of patients with SAP beyond the risk associated with traditional risk factors. Risk predictions were improved when combining information about sCAMs and hsCRP. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",Angina pectoris | C Reactive Protein | Cellular adhesion molecules | Coronary angiography | Prognosis,,"Anand SS, Islam S, Rosengren A, Franzosi MG, Steyn K, Yusufali AH, et al.

Johnston T.P.,24753436700,"Poloxamer 407 increases soluble adhesion molecules, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, in C57BL/6 mice",2009,Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology,61,12,,1681,1688,,15,10.1211/jpp/61.12.0014,,"Objectives: Soluble shedded forms of cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) found in plasma are regarded as surrogate markers for the cellular expression of CAMs. The presence of oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) cholesterol and fatty acids in the plasma, hypertriglyceridaemia and reduced plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are all thought to stimulate an increase in the cellular expression of CAMs such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. Our objectives were to determine how plasma levels of the soluble CAMs were modulated in a mouse model of dyslipidaemia induced chemically with poloxamer 407, and how these changes might be related to changes in the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-C, non-HDL-C and triglycerides. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were given a single intraperitoneal dose of poloxamer 407 (0.5 g/kg) and plasma concentrations of lipid fractions and sCAMs were measured at predetermined time points thereafter. Key findings: The plasma concentrations of each sCAM were significantly increased in our mouse model of atherogenic dyslipidaemia compared with control mice administered saline, although the temporal relationship between the plasma sCAM concentration - time profiles and the plasma lipid concentration - time profiles were not coincident. Conclusions: The atherogenic profile in our mouse model was associated with increases in the plasma concentrations of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin. These changes precede the formation of atherosclerotic lesions shown in previous work. This suggests the use of these sCAMs as biomarkers of future atheroma formation in this particular animal model. © 2009 The Authors.",Atherogenic dyslipidaemia | Biomarker | Coronary artery disease | Poloxamer 407 | Soluble cell adhesion molecules,,"Gordon DJ, Rifkind BM.

The authors' aim was to assess the association of financial loss and social mobility with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 6-9 years after the precipitous collapse. Methods: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Tirana, the Albanian capital, in 2003-6. 467 non-fatal consecutive ACS patients were recruited (370 men aged 59.1 (SD 8.7) years and 97 women 63.3 (SD 7.1) years, 88% response). The control group comprised 469 men (53.1 (SD 10.4) years) and 268 women (54.0 (SD 10.9) years, 69% response). Information on the absolute financial loss (in US$), relative loss and subjective social mobility was obtained by a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Associations of financial loss and social mobility with ACS were assessed by multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Results: Financial loss in pyramid scams was frequent in both ACS patients (55%) and controls (41%). Downward subjective social mobility was noted in 31% of patients and 12% of controls. Upon adjustment for sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics and conventional coronary risk factors, ACS was associated with both financial loss (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.6) and downward social mobility (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.3). Although the association with financial loss was partly mediated through subjective social mobility, both maintained independent associations with ACS. Conclusions: In the wake of a nationwide catastrophic collapse of savings that led to losses totalling about 40% of the Albanian gross domestic product, the authors detected apparent long-term deleterious health effects of financial loss and downward intragenerational subjective social mobility.",,,"Nuri B, Tragakes E, eds.

One of its potential protective mechanisms is the inhibition of the cytokine-induced upregulation of expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs). High sCAM levels were found to be associated with low HDL-c in some studies performed mostly in hyperlipidemic subjects, but this association has not yet been investigated in CAD patients. In addition, conflicting results were obtained from in vitro studies that explored the proposed HDL effect on cytokine-induced CAM expression. The aim of the present case-control study was to investigate whether low HDL-c values are associated with CAM overexpression in normolipidemic CAD patients and healthy individuals, matched according to age and gender. Plasma HDL-c, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and sE-selectin were measured in 37 normolipidemic patients with angiographically verified coronary artery disease and in 52 healthy normolipidemic subjects. The sCAM values obtained in the subjects (patients or controls) with low HDL-c levels (< 1.03 mmol/L) were compared with the values in the subjects with high HDL-c (≥ 1.03 mmol/ L). No significant difference was found between sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and E-selectin values obtained in subjects with low and high HDL-c, either among the patients or the healthy controls. In conclusion, low HDL-c levels are not associated with CAM overexpression in normolipidemic CAD patients and healthy subjects.

Methods and results: Two hundred and ninety-one subjects had fasting levels of circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1(sICAM-1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), sP-selectin and contents of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in granulocyte membranes and adipose tissue determined before undergoing elective coronary angiography. Levels of soluble VCAM-1 (983 ± 216 versus 893 ± 196 ng/l, p < 0.001), ICAM-1 (318 ± 140 versus 290 ± 75 ng/l, p < 0.05) and P-selectin (90 ± 27 versus 80 ± 23 ng/l, p < 0.01) were significantly increased in subjects with significant CAD compared to subjects with no significant stenoses. In a linear regression analysis, both sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin, but not sICAM-1, correlated to the presence and the severity of CAD. Both sICAM-1 and sP-selectin were significantly correlated to current smoking status and a history of myocardial infarction. The content of total n-3 PUFA and docosahexaenoic acid in adipose tissue was marginally, but significant positively correlated to VCAM-1. Conclusion: sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin may serve as markers of CAD in patients with stable angina pectoris. Only sVCAM-1 was weakly correlated to n-3 PUFA in adipose tissue. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Markers of low-grade chronic inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs), have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Objective: To evaluate the significance of inflammatory markers as novel risk factors for CAD in the Chinese population. Methods: High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP); sCAMs, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), P-selectin (sP-selectin) and E-selectin (sE-selectin); and white blood cell (WBC) count were measured in 170 angiographically defined CAD patients (70% or greater stenosis affecting at least one vessel) and 177 healthy control subjects in the Chinese population in Singapore. Results: The levels of Hs-CRP, sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin, and the WBC count were higher in CAD patients than in control subjects (P<0.001, P<0.05, P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in the levels of sICAM-1 and sE-selectin between the two groups. Patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction had higher levels of hs-CRP, and higher WBC and monocyte counts than those with stable angina or atypical chest pain (all P<0.05). The level of sP-selectin in patients with multivessel disease was higher than in those with single-vessel disease (P<0.05). Overall, the levels of hs-CRP and sCAMs showed a significant correlation with the lipid profile and the WBC count. Conclusion: The present study suggests that inflammatory markers, including hs-CRP and WBC count, together with sP-selectin and sVCAM-1, could serve as markers of atherogenesis in Chinese patients with CAD, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. ©2004 Pulsus Group Inc.

On the basis of their efforts, all the different areas of cardiac surgery were able to evolve including coronary artery bypass grafting, heart valve surgery, surgery of the aorta, congenital heart surgery, surgery for rhythm disorders including the implantation of pacemakers and defibrillators, and surgical treatment of advanced heart failure (for example, heart transplantations and mechanical circulatory support). The continued existence of cardiac surgery and its role in medicine in general will depend, to a significant extent, on the future research activities of its protagonists. Cardiac surgeon-scientists will play a pivotal role since they combine clinical experience with scientific knowledge and intuition which make them able to direct research to topics which will matter in the future. However, research costs money, and state or national funds will be not sufficient to support research as much as is necessary. Funding from third parties such as industry will increasingly be required. Due to this, however, the cardiac surgeon-scientist faces various challenges such as the evaluation of his skill in acquiring funds, conflicts with current ethical standards, conflicts of interest when receiving money from industry, and, as a result of the tough competition in this field, the temptation to commit fraud. The head of a department of cardiac surgery holds an important function as his initiative is decisive for the development of visions for the future and for the employment of surgeon-scientists who pursue visionary research. It will take the combined efforts of surgeon-scientists and departmental heads not only to maintain but to extend the position of cardiac surgery in medicine and society even further.",Cardiac surgery | Research,,"Kitz RJ, Biebuyck JF.

Quest'ultimo giustamente nota come i due papiri Haun. 5 e Oxy. 3009, che tramandano una stessa lettera di Filippo ignota alla tradizione manoscritta medievale e indirizzata nel primo ai Beoti e nel secondo ai Peloponnesi (peraltro in questo caso con un prescritto desunto dal § 157), confermino che degli apocrifi non esisteva alcun testo stabilito, assicurandoci indirettamente l'esistenza di piú falsari ; W.

II Teil. Die Rede vom Kranze, Leipzig 1890, comm. ad loc. Ma nella seconda edizione del commento di Blass curata da K. Fuhr nel 1910 si parla esplicitamente di «später Verfasser» (p. 65, comm. ad loc.) ; e Wankel, op. cit., 497, che si richiamano entrambi a L. Robert, Villes d'Asie Mineure. Études de géographie ancienne, Paris 1935 [= 19622], 64 n. 2: Wankel parla esplicitamente di fine del III sec., ma è piú ragionevole pensare con Treves a una data un po' anteriore ; Anche Weil, op. cit., 463 sg. si era posto il problema di un decreto emesso da Bisanzio a nome anche di Perinto, ma cercò di giustificare il fatto ipotizzando che quello tràdito fosse il risultato di una reductio ad unum di due decreti distinti, sí da poter salvare l'autenticità del testo ; Anche Livio (32, 33, 7), nell'esporre le condizioni di pace seguíte a Cinoscefale, dice: Perinthum Byzantiis in antiqui formulam iuris restitui ; L. Canfora, Inventario dei manoscritti greci di Demostene, Padova 1968 ; Cosí Wankel, op. cit., 63 ; H. L. Ahrens, De Graecae linguae dialectis. II. De dialecto dorica, Göttingen 1843, 21 sg. ; R. Koch, Observations grammaticae in decreta, testimonia, epistulas, leges quae extant in Demosthenis orationibus Pro Corona et in Midiam, Münster 1909 ; La tradizione è concorde sia nei casi di timbro mitior sia nei casi di timbro severior, con una sola oscillazione nel caso di Φιλίππω τω̃ Μακεδόνος / Φιλίππου του ̃ Μακεδόνος. Ciononostante W. Dindorf, Demosthenes. V. Annotationes interpretum ad I-XIX, Oxonii 1849, 361 attribuiva ai copisti quell'alternanza capricciosa di timbri che aveva indotto Ahrens a sostenere la falsità del decreto ; e P. Chantraine, Morphologie historique du grec, Paris 19612, 261 ; Cosí ad es. A. Thumb - E. Kieckers, Handbuch der griechischen Dialekte. I, Heidelberg 1932, 136 e Wankel, op. cit., 498, che parlano di «Einmischung ionischer und äolischer Formen» ; in cui però la correzione di Ahrens in γεγε νημένον è accolta da tutti gli editori moderni: anche A. C. Cassio, Iperdorismi callimachei e testo antico dei lirici. (Call. Hy. 5, 109 6, 136), in Tradizione e innovazione nella cultura greca da Omero all'età ellenistica. Scritti in onore di B. Gentili, III, a cura di R. Pretagostini, Roma 1993, 906 ; In un'attestazione di Cos di III sec. è un uomo di Bisanzio a portare questo vezzeggiativo in -ιχος (vd. R. Herzog, Koische Forschungen und Funde, Leipzig 1899, nr. 3) altre attestazioni solo nel Ponto: a Olbia, sia in età ellenistica (IPE I2, 201/2, 10) sia nel V sec. (IGDO nr. 52) ; Su questo sviluppo vd. V. Bubenik, Hellenistic and Roman Greece as a Sociolinguistic Area, Amsterdam - Philadelphia 1989, 69 e 222 ; Vd. F. Gschnitzer, λήϊτος und Verwandtes, «Glotta» 55, 1977, 197 sg ; Koch, op. cit., 35 ; Tra le piú antiche occorrenze del termine ricordate da Koch vd. Diod. Sic. 2, 40, ma una possibile attestazione precedente all'età ellenistica può essere in Dinarco, cui Polluce (8, 156) attribuisee l'uso di αλειτούργητ ος. Per la presenza del termine in iscrizioni ellenistiche vd. IG II2, 682. 17 (Atene) ; Vd. Bubenik, op. cit., 82 sg. che rileva la quasi totale scomparsa degli esiti severiores in Laconia e Messenia in età ellenistica, a fronte della loro tenuta in aree piú periferiche quali Creta e la Cirenaica ; Se ne hanno numerose attestazioni epigrafiche in Sicilia e Magna Grecia a partire da età ellenistica (ma già nel IV sec. nelle tavole di Eraclea: 1, 11. 118 e 2, 10 in A. Uguzzoni - F. Ghinatti, Le tavole greche di Eraclea, Roma 1968), vd. IGDS nrr. 117, 161, 185, 204-209, 212 e IGDGG.I nr. 40 ; Vd. F. Quass, Nomos und Psephisma. Untersuchung zum griechischen Staatsrecht, München 1971, 8 sg.: «Der Ausdruck ρcombining reversed comma aboveήτρα hat die ursprüngliche Bedeutung einer ausdrücklichen und gültigen Formulierung, eines 'Spruches' nicht verloren (wofür sich auch archaische Zeugnisse aus Chios und Sparta finden) und erfüllt je nach den Umständen verschiedene Aufgaben, d. h. ρcombining reversed comma aboveήτρα kann die Stelle eines richterlichen Urteils, einer beschlossenen Anordnung oder auch eines Vertrages einnehmen ... . Als staatsrechtlicher Terminus hat sich ρcombining reversed comma aboveήτρα in späterer Zeit nur noch im dorischen Bereich erhalten ... ; Vd. F. Ghinatti, Profilo di epigrafia greca. Gli orizzonti della ricerca attuale, Catanzaro 1998, 132 sg. Per εcombining comma abovéδ οξε ταcombining ogonek̃ βου λαcombining ogonek̃ καὶ ταcombining ogonek̃ αcombining reversed comma aboveλίαcombining ogonek vd. IGDS nrr. 211-212 (Entella, età ellenistica) ; Una seconda, dubbia attestazione di δαϊο ́ω in Pind. Nem. 1, 66 se si accetta la correzione di Wilamowitz del tràdito δώσειν in δαcombining ogonekώσειν. Tutt'altro che chiara è inoltre l'etimologia di δήϊ ος (di cui δηϊόω è chiaramente un denominativo), come pure il suo rapporto col δάϊος ampiamente attestato in tragedia (a riguardo vd. P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque. Histoire des mots. I-IV, Paris 1968-1980, s. v. δήϊος) ; Seconde Koch, op. cit., 40 invece l'uso del poetico δαι ́ω si spiega come scelta «ad orationem exornandam»: giustificazione riduttiva, a mio avviso, che non rende merito agli intenti del falsario ; in precedenza C. D. Buck, The Source of the so-called Achean-Doric KOINH, «Amer. Jour. Phil.» 21, 1900 ; aveva parlato di κοινά acheo-dorica cui aveva in séguito aggiunto quella etolica (vd. C. D. Buck, The Greek Dialects, Chicago 1955,176-179) ; per quelle in κοινά egea fondamentale M. L. Vásquez, Inscripciones rodias. I-III, Madrid 1988, per la κοινά etolica vd. invece SGDI 1409-1428. È chiaro che è stato anche il ruolo politico dominante delle leghe etolica e achea in funzione antimacedone a favorire il consolidarsi di questa κοινά occidentale, perché l'opposizione era anche linguistica (la cancelleria macedone, ovviamente, usava la κοινή) ; per le relative iscrizioni invece vd. IG XIV, 422-430 (rendiconti di Tauromenio) ; IGDS nrr. 204-212 (i decreti di Entella) ; Non a caso M. Bile, Une koina est-égéenne?, in La koiné grecque antique. II. cit., 133-146 ha avanzato dubbi - a mio avviso legittimi - sull'esistenza di una κοινά egea in senso stretto, nonostante la presenza caratterizzante dell'infinito -μειν, preferendo parlare di tratti dorici comuni presenti nelle iscrizioni dell'Egeo orientale ; (Epidauro) oppure W. R. Paton - E. L. Hicks, The Inscriptions of Cos, Oxford 1891, nr. 369, 3. 7. 9 (Cos) ; Tuttavia, proprio per il dativo plurale dei terni in -ες mancano - sia a causa dell'inconsistenza della documentazione epigrafica sia per via della mancata notazione delle doppie in molte aree ancora in età classica - prove significative di tale restituzione (illuminanti a riguardo la tabella dei dati e la relativa discussione in J. L. García-Ramon, Proportionale Analogie im Griechischen. Der Dativ Pluralis der 3. Deklination in den aiolischen und westgriechischen Dialekten, «Glotta» 68, 1990, 135 sg.) ; M.

To investigate if Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Helicobacter pylori seropositivity is associated with elevated levels of soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) as markers of atherosclerotic activity. Methods. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies to the two bacteria, soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and E-selectin were measured in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients (n = 193) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 193). Two different serological methods were used for the detection of Chlamydia antibodies: Labsystems microimmunofluorescence to detect species-specific C. pneumoniae antibodies and Medac's recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect genus-specific lipopolysaccharide antibodies. Results. The concentrations of sICAM-1 and E-selectin were higher in CHD patients with positive vs. negative Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide IgA (P = 0.044 for both). H. pylori antibodies alone did not predict raised levels of sCAMs, but in CHD patients sICAM-1 was increased with IgA seropositivity to both bacteria compared to double seronegativity (P = 0.034). Concentrations of sVCAM-1 were elevated in CHD patients with double IgA seropositivity compared to those with Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide IgA seropositivity alone (P=0.018). Conclusion. Our results may indicate that C. pneumoniae contributes to increased inflammation in CHD, and that this contribution is even more pronounced when present in combination with H. pylori IgA antibodies.",Chlamydia pneumoniae | Coronary heart disease | E-selectin | Helicobacter pylori | Inflammation | Intercellular cell adhesion molecule | Vascular cell adhesion molecule,,"Ross R.

Methods and Results: Repeated measurements of fasting TG and TGp were made in 29 CAD patients; fasting cholesterol levels (total-C, VLDL, LDL, HDL and small dense LDL) and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) (ICAM-1 and E-selectin) were measured once. Three different TGps were defined: fasting (137.0±60.7 mg/dL) and all other TG levels <200 mg/dL (LL; n=7); a fasting TG level <200 mg/dL (147.0±49.9 mg/dL) and maximum TG levels >200 mg/dL (LH; n=13); and both fasting (225.1±76.2 mg/dL) and maximum TG levels >200 mg/dL (HH; n=9). We then analysed the associations between the TGp types and the lipoprotein phenotype and CAMs. LL had significantly lower values than LH (p<0.05 for all parameters except sE-selectin) and HH (p<0.05 for all parameters) of VLDL (11.2±5.8, 18.8±9.4, 28.1±8.8 mg/dL), LDL-5 (11.6±3.3, 16.4±4.5, 22.1±7.9 mg/dl) and LDL-6 (12.0±3.2, 17.0±5.7, 25.7±9.6 mg/dL), sICAM-1 (209.4±30.3, 267.5±60.6, 273.4±59.1 ng/dL) and sE-selectin (25.1±17.6, 35.5±11.5, 48.5±20.2 ng/dL). Conclusion: Although the differences in fasting TG levels between the LL and LH groups were not significantly different, LH had a more atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype and higher concentrations of adhesion molecules.

Serum sCAM levels in both aortic sinus and coronary sinus were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the transcardiac gradient of sCAMs was calculated. We also evaluated the angiographic severity of CAD, response of coronary artery to acetylcholine (Ach), as well as progression of coronary atherosclerosis over a 6-month period. Results: The transcardiac gradient of sCAMs did not correlate to the angiographic severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The transcardiac gradient of sVCAM-1 was significantly higher in patients with vasoconstrictive response to Ach than patients without vasoconstrictive response to Ach (191.5±98.2 vs. -9.2±14.1 ng/ml, P<0.05). Furthermore, patients who exhibited progression of coronary atherosclerosis had a higher transcardiac gradient of sVCAM-1 at the initial study than patients without progression (47.8±24.5 vs. -6.4±12.3 ng/ml, P<0.05). Conclusions: An elevated transcardiac gradient of sVCAM-1 may represent the persistent activation of coronary artery that is accompanied by endothelial dysfunction, and may be a predictive index of progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Measurement of coronary circulating sVCAM-1 could provide important functional and predictive information about atherosclerosis. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The principle stimulus for expression of sCAMs is believed to be an inflamed atherosclerotic plaque within the coronary vessel. The relationship between levels of sCAMs in the coronary circulation and the peripheral circulation has not been defined. The primary aim of this study was to define the relationship between levels of sCAMs sampled from the systemic circulation and from the coronary circulation. We also set out to document the acute expression of soluble CAMs following coronary angioplasty with or without stent implantation. Methods: The coronary sinus was cannulated in patients undergoing LAD angioplasty. Samples were drawn from left coronary ostium (LCO) and coronary sinus (CS) and femoral vein simultaneously before, immediately after and 4 h after the PTCA procedure. Levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and sP-selectin were measured using ELISA technique. Results: 10 patients (7 male/3 female, 61±11 y) entered the study. There was no significant difference in the levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and sPselectin whether sampled from left coronary ostium, coronary sinus or femoral vein at all time points. There was no significant change in the acute expression of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin following coronary angioplasty. Levels of sP-selectin fell significantly during the PTCA procedure (142±7 ng/ml to 64±6 ng/ml, P<0.001) but then rose again after 4 h and returned toward baseline levels at 24 h. Conclusion: Levels of soluble CAMs sampled in the systemic circulation directly reflect levels in the coronary circulation. Coronary angioplasty results in rapid fall in levels of sP-selectin which returns to normal within 24 h following the procedure. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Cellular adhesion molecules | Coronary circulation | Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,,,Article,,0,23774,2-s2.0-0035135160,01675273,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035135160&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035135160&origin=inward

Soluble CAMs (sCAMs) are shed from cell surfaces and reflect cellular activation. Elevated levels of sCAMs have been reported in the acute coronary syndromes. We hypothesized, therefore, that sCAMs might prove of prognostic value in patients with acute chest pain presumed to be the result of myocardial ischemia. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six consecutive patients with chest pain, thought clinically to represent myocardial ischemia, were studied prospectively. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), E-selectin (sE-selectin) and P-selectin (sP-selectin) levels were assayed at presentation, as were cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase-MB(mass) (CK-MB(mass)). The primary study end point was the occurrence of a serious cardiac event (SCE) during the index admission or the subsequent 3 months. RESULTS: sP-selectin and cTnI levels were significantly higher among patients who had an early SCE (P =.006 and P <.001, respectively). Both remained independently predictive (P <.001) in a multivariate regression equation. The other independent predictor was a history of vascular disease (P <.05). No other markers were significant predictors of early outcome. CONCLUSION: Elevated sP-selectin levels, but not those of other sCAMs, are predictors of early adverse events in patients with chest pain presumed caused by myocardial ischemia.

Various organizational models have been presented for developing the PHO. The PHO entity allows the physicians and the hospital a single entity, representative of both parties, to locate, negotiate and enter into contracts on their behalf. The PHO can allocate revenues among the parties based on the amount of risk and services provided. There are some questions as to the long-term viability of PHOs given the regulatory changes occurring in the healthcare arena. Regardless of the regulatory changes that may occur, PHOs provide a vehicle for enhancing the relationship between a hospital and its physicians. PHOs are often a step in the process of developing a fully integrated healthcare organization. The PHO provides a forum for developing and enhancing trust and collaboration among the physicians and between the physicians and the hospital.

Thallium-201 scintiscans were evaluated with a discriminant function previously developed using the amplitude coefficients of the Fourier transforms of the scams. The technique was applied prospectively to a population of 100 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary arteriography and thallium-201 scintigraphy, including 83 patients with CAD (70% or greater stenosis of luminal diameter) and 17 control subjects. A pretest probability of CAD was determined for each patient from the patient's age, sex and anginal symptoms. The pretest probability was combined with the patient's discriminant score to determine a posttest probability for CAD. For patients with CAD, the mean posttest probability was 0.85. Moreover, 57 of 83 patients (69%) had posttest probabilities exceeding 90%, including 40 patients (48%) with posttest probabilities exceeding 99%. For control subjects, the mean posttest probability was 0.19, with 11 of 17 (65%) having a posttest probability of less than 10%. Overall, 68 subjects had a posttest probability either less than 10% or more than 90% of which 63 were correctly classified (93%). Using a 50% posttest probability as a cutoff for classification, the technique has an 89% sensitivity, an 82% specificity and an overall accuracy of 88%. Therefore, this method objectively distinguishes patients with CAD from control subjects and provides a measure of the certainty of diagnosis. In addition, the discriminant function avoids the problem of inter- and ihtraobserver variability in visually interpreting thallium-201 scans. © 1984.",,,,Article,,0,22415,2-s2.0-0021135869,00029149,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0021135869&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0021135869&origin=inward
