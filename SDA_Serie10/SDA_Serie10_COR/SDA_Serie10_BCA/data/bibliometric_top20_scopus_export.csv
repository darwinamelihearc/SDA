Unlike most computer programs that are used for bibliometric mapping, VOSviewer pays special attention to the graphical representation of bibliometric maps. The functionality of VOSviewer is especially useful for displaying large bibliometric maps in an easy-to-interpret way. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, an overview of VOSviewer's functionality for displaying bibliometric maps is provided. In the second part, the technical implementation of specific parts of the program is discussed. Finally, in the third part, VOSviewer's ability to handle large maps is demonstrated by using the program to construct and display a co-citation map of 5,000 major scientific journals. © 2009 The Author(s).","Bibliometric mapping; Journal co-citation analysis; Science mapping; Visualization; VOS; VOSviewer",,"Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Bollen, J., van de Sompel, H., Hagberg, A., Bettencourt, L., Chute, R., Rodriguez, M.A., Balakireva, L., Clickstream data yields high-resolution maps of science (2009) PLoS ONE, 4 (3), p. 4803; Borg, I., Groenen, P.J.F., (2005) Modern Multidimensional Scaling, , 2nd edn., Berlin: Springer; Börner, K., Chen, C., Boyack, K.W., Visualizing knowledge domains (2003) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 37, pp. 179-255; Boyack, K.W., Klavans, R., Börner, K., Mapping the backbone of science (2005) Scientometrics, 64 (3), pp. 351-374; Chen, C., (2003) Mapping Scientific Frontiers, , Berlin: Springer; Chen, C., CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 57 (3), pp. 359-377; de Moya-Anegón, F., Vargas-Quesada, B., Chinchilla-Rodríguez, Z., Corera-Álvarez, E., Munoz-Fernández, F.J., Herrero-Solana, V., Visualizing the marrow of science (2007) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58 (14), pp. 2167-2179; de Nooy, W., Mrvar, A., Batagelj, V., (2005) Exploratory Social Network Analysis with Pajek, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Eilers, P.H.C., Goeman, J.J., Enhancing scatterplots with smoothed densities (2004) Bioinformatics, 20 (5), pp. 623-628; Fruchterman, T.M.J., Reingold, E.M., Graph drawing by force-directed placement (1991) Software: Practice and Experience, 21 (11), pp. 1129-1164; Garfield, E., From the science of science to Scientometrics visualizing the history of science with HistCite software (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (3), pp. 173-179; Huisman, M., van Duijn, M.A.J., Software for social network analysis (2005) Models and Methods in Social Network Analysis, pp. 270-316. , J.

It differs from the Negative Binomial Distribution in that lack of success, being a non‐event, is not punished by increased chance of failure. It is shown that such a stochastic law is governed by the Beta Function, containing only one free parameter, and this is approximated by a skew or hyperbolic distribution of the type that is widespread in bibliometrics and diverse social science phenomena. In particular, this is shown to be an appropriate underlying probabilistic theory for the Bradford Law, the Lotka Law, the Pareto and Zipf Distributions, and for all the empirical results of citation frequency analysis. As side results one may derive also the obsolescence factor for literature use. The Beta Function is peculiarly elegant for these manifold purposes because it yields both the actual and the cumulative distributions in simple form, and contains a limiting case of an inverse square law to which many empirical distributions conform.

In such cases, the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis have provided useful data. This paper presents the forecasts for three emerging technology areas by integrating the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis into well-known technology forecasting tools such as scenario planning, growth curves and analogies. System dynamics is also used to be able to model the dynamic ecosystem of the technologies and their diffusion. Technologies being forecasted are fuel cell, food safety and optical storage technologies. Results from these three applications help us to validate the proposed methods as appropriate tools to forecast emerging technologies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A number of literature reviews have been published focusing on specific aspects of green supply chain management such as performance measurement, supplier selection/evaluation, analytical modeling efforts, and some others with broader areas of focus. This paper presents a thorough bibliometric and network analysis that provides insights not previously fully grasped or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. The analysis begins by identifying over 1000 published studies, which are then distilled down to works of proven influence and those authored by influential investigators. Using rigorous bibliometric tools, established and emergent research clusters are identified for topological analysis, identification of key research topics, interrelations, and collaboration patterns. This systematic mapping of the field helps graphically illustrate the publications evolution over time and identify areas of current research interests and potential directions for future research. The findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometrics; Environmental sustainability; Green supply chain; Literature review; Network analysis","Electric network analysis; Publishing; Sustainable development; Topology; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Collaboration patterns; Environmental sustainability; Green supply chain; Green supply chain management; Literature reviews; Performance measurements; Supply chain management","Abdallah, T., Farhat, A., Diabat, A., Kennedy, S., Green supply chains with carbon trading and environmental sourcing: Formulation and life cycle assessment (2012) Appl.

Main differences in publication and citation behavior between the (basic) sciences and the social sciences and humanities are outlined. Limitations of the (S)SCI and A&HCI for monitoring research performance are considered. For research performance monitoring in many social sciences and humanities, the methods used in science need to be extended. A broader range of both publications (including non-ISI journals and monographs) and citation indicators (including non-ISI reference citation values) is needed. Three options for bibliometric monitoring are discussed.",,,"Adair, J.G., Vohra, N., The explosion of knowledge, references, and citations.

The problem, however, is not the ranking as such. The indicators used for ranking are often not advanced enough, and this situation is part of the broader problem of the application of insufficiently developed bibliometric indicators used by persons who do not have clear competence and experience in the field of quantitative studies of science. After a brief overview of the basic elements of bibliometric analysis, I discuss the major technical and methodological problems in the application of publication and citation data in the context of evaluation. Then I contend that the core of the problem lies not necessarily at the side of the data producer. Quite often persons responsible for research performance evaluation, for instance scientists themselves in their role as head of institutions and departments, science administrators at the government level and other policy makers show an attitude that encourages 'quick and dirty' bibliometric analyses whereas better quality is available. Finally, the necessary conditions for a successful application of advanced bibliometric indicators as support tool for peer review are discussed. Copyright © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

We use the results of a large evaluation study of 147 university chemistry research groups in the Netherlands covering the work of about 700 senior researchers during the period 1991-2000. Thus, we deal with research groups rather than individual scientists, as we consider the research group as the most important work floor unit in research, particularly in the natural sciences. Furthermore, we restrict the citation period to a three-year window instead of 'life time counts' in order to focus on the impact of recent work and thus on current research performance. Results show that the h-index and our bibliometric 'crown indicator' both relate in a quite comparable way with peer judgments. But for smaller groups in fields with 'less heavy citation traffic' the crown indicator appears to be a more appropriate measure of research performance.

Such methods introduce a measure of objectivity into the evaluation of scientific literature and hold the potential to increase rigor and mitigate researcher bias in reviews of scientific literature by aggregating the opinions of multiple scholars working in the field. We introduce the bibliometric methods of citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographical coupling, co-author analysis, and co-word analysis and present a workflow for conducting bibliometric studies with guidelines for researchers. We envision that bibliometric methods will complement meta-analysis and qualitative structured literature reviews as a method for reviewing and evaluating scientific literature. To demonstrate bibliometric methods, we performed a citation and co-citation analysis to map the intellectual structure of the Organizational Research Methods journal. © The Author(s) 2014","bibliographic coupling; bibliometrics; co-citation; science mapping",,"Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Casanueva, C., Galan, J.L., Co-authorship in management and organizational studies: An empirical and network analysis (2006) Journal of Management Studies, 43 (5), pp. 957-983; Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Galan, J.L., The resource-based theory: Dissemination and main trends (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27 (7), pp. 621-636; Acedo, F.J., Casillas, J.C., Current paradigms in the international management field: An author co-citation analysis (2005) International Business Review, 14 (5), pp. 619-639; Aguinis, H., Pierce, C.A., Bosco, F.A., Dalton, D.R., Dalton, C.M., Debunking myths and urban legends about meta-analysis (2011) Organizational Research Methods, 14 (2), pp. 306-331; Aguinis, H., Pierce, C.A., Bosco, F.A., Muslin, I.S., First decade of Organizational Research Methods: Trends in design, measurement, and data-analysis topics (2009) Organizational Research Methods, 12 (1), pp. 69-112; Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson’s correlation coefficient (2003) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 54 (6), pp. 550-560; Artto, K., Martinsuo, M., Gemuendne, H.G., Murtoaro, J., Foundations of program management: A bibliometric view (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (1), pp. 1-18; Backhaus, K., Luegger, K., Koch, M., The structure and evolution of business-to-business marketing: A citation and co-citation analysis (2011) Industrial Marketing Management, 40 (6, SI), pp. 940-951; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., PajekPprogram for large network analysis (1998) Connections, 21 (2), pp. 47-57; Baumgartner, H., Bibliometric reflections on the history of consumer research (2010) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 20 (3), pp. 233-238; Benavides-Velasco, C.A., Quintana-García, C., Guzmán-Parra, V.F., Trends in family business research (2011) Small Business Economics, 40 (1), pp. 41-57; Bernroider, E.W., Pilkington, A., Córdoba, J.-R., Research in information systems: A study of diversity and inter-disciplinary discourse in the AIS basket journals between 1995 and 2011 (2013) Journal of Information Technology, 28 (1), pp. 74-89; Bhupatiraju, S., Nomaler, Triulzi, G., Verspagen, B., Knowledge flows—Analyzing the core literature of innovation, entrepreneurship and science and technology studies (2012) Research Policy, 41 (7), pp. 1205-1218; Biemans, W., Griffin, A., Moenaert, R., Twenty years of the Journal of Product Innovation Management: History, participants, and knowledge stock and flows (2007) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 24 (3), pp. 193-213; Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), pp. 77-84; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008 (10), p.

The nature and magnitude of collaboration vary from one discipline to another, and depend upon such factors as the nature of the research problem, the research environ ment, and demographic factors. Earlier studies have shown a high degree of correlation between collaboration and research productivity, and between collaboration and financial support for research. The extent of collaboration cannot be easily determined by traditional methods of survey and observation. Bibliometric methods offer a convenient and non-reactive tool for studying collaboration in research. In this paper, several types of collaboration have been identified, and earlier research on collaboration has been reviewed. Further research is needed to refine the methods of defining and assessing collaboration and its impact on the organization of research and communication in science. © 1983, Sage Publications.

In this study, we reexamine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (a) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (b) analyze the data across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical technique - segmented regression analysis - which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (a) the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (b) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars, and 8 to 9% to 2010. © 2015 ASIS&T.","bibliometrics","Growth rate; Information science; Regression analysis; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Growth of science; History of science; Segmented regressions; Specific segments; Statistical techniques; Web of Science; Publishing; growth curve; growth rate; health science; natural science; publication; regression analysis; Web of Science","Bornmann, L., Scientific peer review (2011) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 45, pp. 199-245; Bornmann, L., Measuring the societal impact of research (2012) EMBO Reports, 13 (8), pp. 673-676; Bornmann, L., What is societal impact of research and how can it be assessed?

Yet no consensus about progress has been achieved in the corporate social responsibility/corporate social performance literature. In this article, we seek to analyze three views on this literature. One view is that development occurred from conceptual vagueness, through clarification of central constructs and their relationships, to the testing of theory - a process supported by increased sophistication in research methods. In contrast, other authors claim that hardly any progress is to be expected because of the inherently normative character of the literature. A final view is that progress in the literature on the social responsibilities of business is obscured or even hampered by the continuing introduction of new constructs. This article explores which of these three views better describes the evolution of the literature during a period of 30 years and suggests implications for further research. © 2005 Sage Publications.","Bibliometry; Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Theory development",,"Abbott, W.F., Monsen, R.J., On the measurement of corporate social responsibility: Self-reported disclosures as a method of measuring corporate social involvement (1979) Academy of Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 501-515; Alexander, G.J., Buchholz, R.A., Corporate social responsibility and stock-market performance (1978) Academy of Management Journal, 21 (3), pp. 479-486; Arlow, P., Personal characteristics in college-students evaluations of business ethics and corporate social-responsibility (1991) Journal of Business Ethics, 10 (1), pp. 63-69; Aupperle, K.E., Carroll, A.B., Hatfield, J.D., An empirical-examination of the relationship between corporate social-responsibility and profitability (1985) Academy of Management Journal, 28 (2), pp. 446-463; Barley, S.R., Meyer, G.W., Gash, D.C., Cultures of culture.

It is perhaps the most popular bibliometric product used in bibliometrics itself, as well as outside the scientific community. First, a concise review of the background and history of the ISI impact factor and the basic ideas underlying it are given. A cross-citation matrix is used to visualise the construction of the Impact Factor and several related journal citation measures. Both strengths and flaws of the impact factor are discussed. Several attempts made by different authors to introduce more sophisticated journal citation measures and the reasons why many indicators aiming at a correction of methodological limitations of the Impact Factor were not successful are described. The next section is devoted to the analysis of basic technical and methodological aspects. In this context, the most important sources of possible biases and distortions for calculation and use of journal citation measures are studied. Thereafter, main characteristics of application contexts are summarised. The last section is concerned with questions of statistical reliability of journal citation measures. It is shown that in contrast to a common misbelief statistical methods can be applied to discrete 'skewed' distributions, and that the statistical reliability of these statistics can be used as a basis for application of journal impact measures in comparative analyses. Finally, the question of sufficiency or insufficiency of a single, howsoever complex measure for characterising the citation impact of scientific journals is discussed.",,,,,,"Springer Netherlands",,,,,"English","Scientometrics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-19044365589

Co-word analysis was employed to reveal patterns and trends in the IR field by measuring the association strengths of terms representative of relevant publications or other texts produced in IR field. Data were collected from Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period of 1987-1997. In addition to the keywords added by the SCI and SSCI databases, other important keywords were extracted from titles and abstracts manually. These keywords were further standardized using vocabulary control tools. In order to trace the dynamic changes of the IR field, the whole 11-year period was further separated into two consecutive periods: 1987-1991 and 1992-1997. The results show that the IR field has some established research themes and it also changes rapidly to embrace new themes. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Co-word analysis; Information retrieval research; Research trends; Science citation index; Social science citation index","Data structures; Database systems; Natural language processing systems; Co-word analysis; Information retrieval","Arabie, P., Carroll, J.D., DeSarbo, W.S., (1987) Three-way scaling and clustering, , Newbury Park: Sage Publications; Bhattacharya, S., Basu, R.K., Mapping a research area at the micro level using co-word analysis (1998) Scientometrics, 43 (3), pp. 359-372; Callon, M., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Co-word analysis as a tool for describing the network of interactions between basic and technological research: The case of polymer chemistry (1991) Scientometrics, 22 (1), pp. 153-205; Cambrosio, A., Limoges, C., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Historical scientometrics?

The paper describes various types of information added to the database: data on articles citing the Dutch publications; detailed citation data on ISI journals and subfields; and a classification system of publishing main organizations, appearing in the addresses. Moreover, an overview is given of the types of bibliometric indicators that were constructed. Their relationship to indicators developed by other researchers in the field is discussed. Finally, two applications are given in order to illustrate the potentials of the database and of the bibliometric indicators derived from it. The first represents a synthesis of 'classical' macro indicator studies at the one hand, and bibliometric analyses of research groups or institutes at the other. The second application gives for the first time a detailed analysis of a country's publication output per institutional sector. © 1995 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"Moed, H.F., de Bruin, R.E., Beerens, J., Schoneveld, J.A., Vriend, I., (1992) A Bibliometric System for the Assessment of National Research Performance: Database Description and First Application, , Research Report to the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, Report CWTS 92-03, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden; de Bruin, R.E., Moed, H.F., Schoneveld, J.A., (1992) Scientific Cooperation between the Public and Private Sector in the Netherlands (1980–1989), , Report prepared for the Netherlands Ministry of Education and Science, Report CWTS 92-04, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden; Moed, H.F., van der Velde, J.G.M., (1993) Bibliometric Profiles of Academic Chemistry Research in the Netherlands, , Research Report to the Netherlands Foundation for Chemical Research (SON), and to the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), CWTS, Report CWTS 93-08, Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden; Moed, H.F., Ramaekers, A.M.P.H., Bibliometric Profiles of Academic Biology Research in the Netherlands (1994) Netherlands Biology in the Nineties, , Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU), Utrecht; H.

Nalimov coined the term 'scientometrics' in the 1960s, this term has grown in popularity and is used to describe the study of science: growth, structure, interrelationships and productivity. Scientometrics is related to and has overlapping interests with bibliometrics and informetrics. The terms bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics refer to component fields related to the study of the dynamics of disciplines as reflected in the production of their literature. Areas of study range from charting changes in the output of a scholarly field through time and across countries, to the library collection problem of maintaining control of the output, and to the low publication productivity of most researchers. These terms are used to describe similar and overlapping methodologies. The origins and historical survey of the development of each of these terms are presented. Profiles of the usage of each of these terms over time are presented, using an appropriate subject category of databases on the DIALOG information service. Various definitions of each of the terms are provided from an examination of the literature. The size of the overall literature of these fields is determined and the growth and stabilisation of both the dissertation and non-dissertation literature are shown. A listing of the top journals in the three fields are given, as well as a list of the major reviews and bibliographies that have been published over the years.",,,"Almind, T.C., Ingwersen, P., Informetric analyses on the World Wide Web: Methodological approaches to 'webometrics' (1997) Journal of Documentation, 53, pp. 404-426; Blackert, L., Segel, K., Ist in der wissenschaftlich-technischen information platz für die INFORMETRIE?

In this study bibliometric indicators were calculated for all research groups in the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Leiden. Bibliometric results were discussed with a number of researchers from the two faculties involved. Our main conclusion is that the use of bibliometric data for evaluation purposes carries a number of problems, both with respect to data collection and handling, and with respect to the interpretation of bibliometric results. However, most of these problems can be overcome. When used properly, bibliometric indicators can provide a ""monitoring device"" for university research-management and science policy. They enable research policy-makers to ask relevant questions of researchers on their scientific performance, in order to find explanations of the bibliometric results in terms of factors relevant to policy. © 1985.",,,"van Raan, Frankfort, An Approach to University Science Policy: A New Research Funding System (1980) International Journal of Institutional Management in Higher Education, 4, pp. 155-163; Martin, Irvine, Assessing Basic Research: Some Partical Indicators of Scientific Progress in Radio Astronomy (1983) Research Policy, 12, pp. 61-90; Moed, Burger, Frankfort, van Raan, (1983) On the Measurement of Research Performance: the Use of Bibliometric Indicators, , Research Policy Unit of the University of Leiden, Leiden; Chang, Evaluation and survey of a Subfield of Physics: Magnetic Resonance and Relaxation Studies in The Netherlands (1975) FOM Report 37175, , FOM, Utrecht; Over Leven (1982) Report of the Verkenningscommissie Biochemie, , National Survey Committee on Biochemistry, Staatsuitgeverij, The Hague, (in Dutch)",,,,,,,,"English","Res Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000281652
